         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Let this letter then be reckoned as a Tax payd to Cuſtome: being ſadly ſenſible that the labours of greateſt merit are like to ſuffer as abrupt, &amp; rude, except the Reader be courted and invited in the Dedication: There is one grievance more, which I earneſtly deprecate; You commonly date the worth of the book, from the Abilities you taſte in the Epiſtle; and if this Humor prevaile here, I am Undone. Beſides, you deſtroy my harmleſs deſigne, which was to try whether the Noble
<pb facs="tcp:170361:4"/> conceptions of the Monſieur, would admitt of any Advantage, and appear more orient, as they are foil'd by this trifle:</p>
            <p>If any ſhall diſpute the Decency of the Title, and aſke, How theſe letters came to be call'd <hi>choiſe,</hi> ſince none fell from the ſame incomparable pen, which did not challenge the ſame Denomination; J ſhall eaſily yeeld: but, muſt crave leave to affirme; that by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of high diſcernment, theſe have bin gather'd as prime Stars from the other <hi>Sporades,</hi> and are here preſented in one entire Conſtellation: There was nothing but Gold in the whole Mine; but here you will find ſuch as has bin tried and ſtamp'd and paſſ'd in all places, not only Currant, but Admir'd.</p>
            <p>He is much a ſtranger to the world, that does not know that the ſtyle of Monſieur <hi>Balzac</hi> was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in <hi>France,</hi> as the Treaſure and Teſt of Elegance: And he was eſteem'd the beſt proficient, in that which they call <hi>flos linguae,</hi> the Delicacy, fineneſs, and Idiom of language, who had attayn'd the neareſt Reſemblance of this Author; Obſerve the vigour and flame of his fancy, the Cleanneſſe and Roundneſſe of his expreſſion, the ſpirit and briskneſſe of his Notions, the prudence and Inſinuation of all his Addreſſes, and you will judge him a fit Parallel for any of his Predeceſſors, that <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Athens</hi> has moſt celebrated.</p>
            <p>The Comedian was handſomely, careſſ'd by him that ſaid, If Jupiter would ſpeake Latine, He might find Apparrell for his thoughts in <hi>Plautus</hi> his ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe; Poſſibly, if the ſame <hi>Jove</hi> had occaſion to

            <p>I am unwilling to be guilty of ſo much folly, as to define or diſtinguiſh Letters, and then liſt them under their ſeverall Colours, deſcanting upon thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which render them peculiarly gratefull to knowing men: leſt any ſhould ſuſpect that this one Letter was not written by my ſelfe.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot apprehend upon what inducements you perſiſt ſo reſolutely to love me. My un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable deportment might have extinguiſht the ardour of your paſſion; and I know not any reaſon that could oblige you to court the amity of the moſt unſociable and uſeleſſe perſon in the world. Certainly, 'tis a very ſtrong and generous inclination, that moves you towards a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo little attractive, and brings your Cares even as farre as this Deſart, wherein they can neither meet the entertainment
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170361:12"/> they deſerve, nor be return'd with due acknowledgments. I am not diſpleaſ'd with the contentment you teſtifie of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereof you make ſo favourable mention; but it would much provoke my Choler, if having been written as my laſt, the ſucceſſe ſhould croſſe my deſigne, and I ſhould be againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd by it into a <hi>Chaos</hi> of complements, out of which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd I had for ever made an eſcape. You may reproach the rudeneſſe and auſterity of my humour as long as you pleaſe, whilſt I continue a perfect hatred to the profeſſion, that firſt raiſ'd me in the world's opinion. I have diſcarded all my <hi>Hyperboles</hi> and my <hi>Antitheſes,</hi> with the reſt of the paint of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick.</hi> Therefore, notwithſtanding my devotion to the perſon you ſpeak of, 'tis a greater violence then I can enforce upon my ſelfe, to undertake the Title and Office of a Wit; and write let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to her, without either matter or occaſion. Since my quiet is not unregarded by you, I beſeech your dexterity to divert ſuch kind of tempeſts, and that I may receive this courteſie from you in lieu of that you deſigne in my favour from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Commiſſary. Two yeares are paſt, ſince I was in the thoughts of his Lord the Treaſurer: and if in that ſpace, I had fed only upon returnes from the Exchequer, you may imagine, my fare would have been extreamly ſlender and Philoſophicall. I ſhould, now be as meager and hollow as the Creatures that <hi>Pharoah</hi> dreamt of, and the Patriarch <hi>Ioſeph</hi> interpreted. There is an Epigram of <hi>Martialls,</hi> we have ſometime read together, which might have afforded me compariſons to my dryneſſe: but that I was willing to give you notice, by the way, of my knowledge in the Hebrew, and that I could uſe the Dialect of ſome <hi>Rabbines</hi> of my acquaintance: the pleaſantneſſe of this raillery, will aſſure you, that I am not caſt down with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly and diſcontent. But yet, to declare my ſelfe well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd, and to pretend to belong to the Court by my Letters, now I do not ſo by my Penſion; would be ſuch an abſurdity, as might entertaine the ſpleen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, of the <hi>Momus's,</hi> and I ſhould have no reaſon to be offended at their mirth. If I am paid, I ſhall be oblig'd to the Pay-maſter, and yet not maligne any perſon. Though I be not paid at all, I here find reall conſolations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt afflictions a thouſand times greater: And I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve very ill of Philoſophy, if having received more valuable benefits from her, then fortune ha's denyed me, I ſhould in this condition repine at any thing whatſoever. 'Tis for your friendſhip, Sir, that I acknowledge an engagement to my ſtarrs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170361:12"/> and I beſeech you to believe that I am and ſhall ever-be-moſt paſſionately,</p>

                  <p>I Cannot approve your ſcrupulous and exceſſive modeſty, nor eſteem it other then an injury to my affection that you tell me, you are deficient in your husbandry and improvment of it as you ought. It is too well rooted to need ſuch curious looking to, and is none of thoſe tender plants that fade imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, if they miſſe one dayes watering. Things of robuſt and vigorous natures, do not require ſuch continuall care and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie; and their own firmeneſſe ſecures them enough, without the ſolicitous diligence of another. I will not put you to any trouble to preſerve me, leave me to my own fidelity, and you ſhall never complaine of my loſſe. It is ſufficient that I know you love me, and I acknowledge I have received ſuch infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proofs of this truth, that it is not poſſible for me to doubt its reality. You may ſpare all further care then upon what is eſſentiall; words are no longer the marks of intentions. There is a trafick of ſmoak driven as well by Letters, as by voice: and the honeſteſt man that I ſaw in <hi>Italy</hi> would not vouchſafe ſo much as to unſeale thoſe that were deliver'd to him on the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydaies of the Carnevall, (you underſtand the manner of that Country.) This was indeed to put the juſt valew upon trifles, and to rate them agreeably to their worth. There could be no greater juſtice render'd to Complements, then not to read them when they were received, in regard they were not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded when they were written. For my part, I do ſo little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe affections in picture, that if the opinion I have of your generoſity were capable of augmentation, it would have been raiſ'd to greater aſſurance, in that you treat me with leſſe ceremony and talk. It is certainly very reproachfull to have grown old in an abſolute conjunction of fouls, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to be ſtill at Proteſtations the firſt rudiments of Friendſhip.

                  <p>THe infinite value which I ſet upon your love, ha's made me receive the tokens of it with a ſort of extaſie and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph: and although as to the eſſentiall part of friendſhip your generoſity do's ſufficiently aſſure my poſſeſſion, yet it is great contentment to me, that I have that in my Cabinet which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably confirmes my Title.

                  <p>I Conceive not your purpoſe in your ſo waſtfull profuſion of your Rhetorick, and heaping ſuch elaborate complements upon me. Certainly, you could not have imployed more, to gaine a coy Miſtreſſe, or impoſe upon a credulous Enemy. It's a cleare evidence you have breath'd the Aire of Florence, and been ſcorched with the Sun of Rome; and that you are but lately arrived from the land of Eloquence. But though you come from that country, me-thinks you ought not to have uſ'd their ſtyle of <hi>Italy,</hi> when you are treating with an ancient <hi>Gaule.</hi> Theſe careſſes which would oblige another man, are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner injurious to me; and you wrong my affection in imagining it to ſtand in need of your fine language to feed and maintaine it's heat. I can profeſſe of my ſelfe, without vanity; that I am an honeſt and good man; and on the other ſide without flattery, declare you for a perſon exceeding generous. And theſe being undiſputable certainties, how can you apprehend any hazard of our friendſhip by our ſilence? does it depend onely upon a dozen lines every month? or is it built upon a foundation of Paper, that is, upon one of the ſlighteſt and weakeſt things in nature? I am not of this beliefe; and though I might juſtly blame my own pertinacious ſlothfullneſſe, and alledge the multiplicity of your affaires for the diſcontinuance of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, yet I had rather referre it to the confidence of a perfect affection, which giving us an undoubted aſſurance each

                  <p>I Had not a leſſe firme perſwaſion of the immutableneſſe of your affection before, then I have now upon the receit of your Letter. Men knew how to love and to be faithfull too, before the art of writing was diſcover'd: And ſince that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention they have lyed, deceived, and betrayed one another with greater facility and cunning. Nay, the crafty malice of ſome ha's even practiſ'd poiſoning by Letters; and revenge ha's been Ingenious to turne theſe marks of friendſhip into inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of deſtruction. Yet I do not inferre from hence, that we ſhould therefore never truſt to a way of communication which may in poſſibility prove ſo dangerous. I onely ſay, we are not to be ſo preciſe about evidences of that dubiouſneſſe, and which ſerve oftentimes as well to diſguiſe and corrupt truth as to declare it. 'Tis from our hearts that we receive ſincere teſtimonies and aſſurances of our mutuall paſſion, though our commerce ha's not been manag'd with the ſtirre and heat of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers and replyes, yet neither ha's our quiet been cold and life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; nor is ſilence the ſame thing with oblivion. Certainly if ſilence will not be allowed in the rank of Vertues, yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines innocence in it, and do's nothing at all detract from the purity of engaged fidelity: But which is ſome thing more, it conſerves it in the memory, by locking and keeping it up in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. There is a certaine Author, either ancient or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, that in favour of this happy ſilence pronounces it, <hi>The nouriſhment of the ſoul and its conceptions.</hi> I preſume therefore,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170361:15"/> that theſe tenne yeares paſt, you have had my company with you in contemplation. My pourtrait, (but far better drawn and by a more maſterly hand, then that which you have of <hi>Ferdinand's</hi> doing) ha's never been out of your ſight; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly you have meditated of me during all this long inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our converſe. You ſee what juſtice I do your friendſhip; and will not you judge as candidly of mine? And unleſſe I ſhould now aſſure you that I reſound your name, over all this Province; that I fill this part of the world with relations of the wonders of your generoſity, and of the greatneſſe of your accompliſhments, and that when I would feaſt my fancy and entertaine it magnificently, I betake my ſelfe to the Court of King <hi>Polexander,</hi> could you poſſibly doubt of the certainty of ſuch manifeſt and hiſtoricall truth? Since you know me ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as you do, I conceive there is no neceſſity of unripping my breſt to you every day: and being alſo fully perſwaded of the affection I have for you, you cannot in reaſon doubt, that I am in all ſincerity, or to ſpeak in the ſtyle of thoſe that come from <hi>Paris,</hi> that I am effectively,</p>

                  <p>HOwever you are of a contrary opinion, your friend ha's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to curſe his profeſſion. The ſtipend of a Partiſan is preferable to the reputation of a Poet, and 'tis better to lodge in gilded Palaces, then to chante of the Golden age and lye in an Hoſpitall. The famed <hi>Torquato Taſſo</hi> wore tatter'd breeches, and ſtood in need of charity. There is a Letter of his abroad in the world, wherein he implores the largeſſe of a crowne. And yet there is a certaine <hi>Ignorant</hi> that I could name, who counts his wealth by Millions, and pities the indigence of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour of <hi>Venice.</hi> He dreames of purchaſing Principalities and Kingdomes, if there were any to be ſold; and his high rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have ſcarce left him humility enough to judge himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of leſſe then Crownes and Scepters. But, I beſeech you, what meanes Monſieur the Kings Advocate to engage himſelfe into the trouble of writing books? This is ſuch an unſeaſonable abſurdity as admits of no excuſe. Surely 'tis too much Vacation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170361:16"/> with him in his Law-Practice, and there is no great crowding in his apartment at the <hi>Palais.</hi> I cannot tell what he would have me ſay concerning the firſt race of our Kings, and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin obſervations upon the <hi>Salick</hi> Law. If he ſhould ſend me the contract of <hi>Pharamund's</hi> mariage, and an extract of <hi>Meroiiée's</hi> laſt will and Teſtament; or, to go higher, if he ſhould preſent me with the originall of the Twelve Tables of the old Roman Lawes; with the firſt draught of thoſe of <hi>Solon,</hi> or the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of thoſe of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and <hi>Charondas;</hi> yet all theſe rarities would not have power enough to awaken my benummed curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or tempt me in the leaſt to a deſire of knowing more then I do already. My humour is become ſo faſtidious of every thing that is Grave or Serious, that my appetite cannot poſſibly be reſtored, but by ſomewhat that is very delightfull and Merry. In the mood wherein I am at preſent, I would give both the Goddeſſes of Equity and Juſtice, with all the skill in the Lawes, the Ethicks, and the Politickes; for one drinking-ſong. I am not able to continue the trade any longer. The expectation of golden Letters from me is too unreaſonable for my ſtock to furniſh. But even now, I was overwhelm'd in a great crowd of complements of diverſe languages; ſo that rather then go about to pay my debts, I am reſolv'd to break, and make a ſolemne renunciation to all my Greek, Latin, and French. I would ſooner chooſe to get my ſelfe naturaliz'd in <hi>Baſe Bretagne</hi> and buy the place of a Tax-gatherer in the Town of <hi>Quinpercorentin.</hi> 'Tis more then four nights, ſince I cloſ'd my eyes to ſleep.

                  <p>I Had very unquiet apprehenſions of the Catarrhe of Monſieur de —, and your Letter ha's not deliver'd me from them, How well complexion'd ſoever he appeares to your eye, I ever ſuſpected the falſeneſſe of that ſcarlet in his cheeks from the firſt day I ſaw him. There are deceitfull ſhews of a firme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and roſes of an ill omen. 'Tis not Art alone that is guilty of dawbing and counterfeit; Nature do's ſome times diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170361:16"/> and flatter us with a falſe Gloſſe. And hence it is, that I do not alwayes paſſe my judgment in favour of florid faces and a good colour. Yet I would not have you adde deſpaire to a man who ha's already received the allarme. Onely adviſe him thus from me, that he take care to ſettle his mind in peace, and that I forbid him ſtudying with as much caution as riot. Since you aſſure me he ha's a great beliefe in my counſells, I enjoyne him to make no more Prefaces or Paraphraſes; indeed, not to do any thing at all either in Proſe or Verſe, as an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or Tranſlarour. And this upon paine of incurring the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the dumbe Muſe I lately ſhew'd, him, which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a certaine Greek to the other Nine. She was well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd, as ſhe affirm'd, with the ſecrecy of his thoughts, and a quiet poſſeſſion of his Soul. O prudent Muſe! tranſcendently more diſcreet then all her ſiſters. Of what incomparable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency is ſilence, and how great the vanity of words and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony! We commit ſins enough beſide this, and there is nothing admits of a more eaſie reformation. But we had rather get rheumes and catarrhes, diſtill our brains by drops, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hecticall and conſumptive over our papers, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to make Prefaces and Paraphraſes. In expectance of better newes of the health of Monſieur <hi>de</hi> —, I reſt,</p>

                  <p>VVIth your permiſſion I will begin my Letter as you end all yours, and tell you that I am overpreſſ'd as well as you, although it be not with ſo faire a burden. I profeſſe my ſelfe a fugitive from the world and a deſertour of civill ſociety. I proclaime this as much as poſſibly I can. And yet this world and this ſociety make ſemblance not to underſtand me. They take no notice of a vow, which I cauſed to be publiſh'd in print, that every one might know it. My ſilence is moleſted every day by other mens Eloquence, and in penance for my ſins I am forc'd to become the mark againſt which all the complements of France are levell'd. Is it impoſſible for me to be quit of this trade of a Letter-maker, which drawes perſecution upon me from every ſide? And is there no way to reſigne it into the hands
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170361:17"/> of ſome of our Brethren of the Academy, who perhaps loves the employment and new acquaintances better then I do? Is it not extreamly ridiculous to have no buſineſſe, and yet to write as much as a dozen Bankers; to be idle in perpetuall action, and notwithſtanding alwayes at leiſure, not to have ſo much ſpare time as to pick ſtrawes on Holy dayes? I would faine keep my ſelfe for a few, and admit comerce only with ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect perſons. But what reaſon is there to expect a punctuall anſwer from me to Queſtions that come from <hi>Roiergne</hi> and <hi>Givaudan?</hi> or that I ſhould make an Elogium upon a book ſent me from <hi>Caſtelnau d'Arry,</hi> and give my approbation to a piece of Barbary-Latine, or low Brittany French? In which I muſt delude ſome with flattery, and incurre the diſpleaſure of others by my freedome? Pardon me, I beſeech you, the untoward humour wherein I am: I did not think it would have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported me ſo farre. Three great packets have irritated it, and almoſt made me forget what I owe to the civility of your friend. I intend to give him thanks more at large: But it cannot be till the returne of the next Poſt. I need at leaſt a weeks time to compoſe my braine, and reduce the acrimony of my Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick. I am ever moſt paſſionately,</p>

                  <p>I Do but little trouble my ſelfe with the thought of Eloquence, and much leſſe of Fortune. I am fallen into that extream degree of languiſhment, that I have ſcarce ſtrength enough to tell you of my deplorable condition, or courage to deſire the health I want.

'Tis not Sir, that I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo preciſely devoted to ſobriety, but becauſe I have loſt my appetite.

When I imagine the patheticall beſeechings to which he was neceſſitated to deſcend for the obtaining of an ordinary anſwer, I bluſh for ſhame at tenne leagues diſtance, and a month after the thing done. Pardon my weakeneſſe; I am the worſt beggar in France, I cannot crave importunately, or be glad of a favour that is gotten ſo. Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — was too obliging to debaſe himſelfe ſo much in my behalfe and to eſteem nothing unworthy of his quality, whereby he might do me a kindneſſe. I ſhall deſire much leſſe from him another time. I had rather have only his good wiſhes naked and pure, then his good turnes that come with ſo much violence, and are rather extorted then granted. And the caſe would be equally

                  <p>YOu think you have done me but one favour, and I account I have received two. For in my Arithmetick 'tis a ſecond benefit, that you did not expect till I requeſted for the firſt; and the favour you have done me is not of much greater value with me, then what your readineſſe to anticipate my deſires ha's ſpar'd me. A man that petitions with trembling, and falls back upon the leaſt refuſall; who ha's all the neceſſary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that go to the making up of an ill Courtier is very much oblig'd to you for pardoning him ſo many feares and inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes as he ſhould have undergone in his addreſſes to you; and for that you have not had leſſe regard to his modeſty then his wants. Theſe goodneſſes are not after the faſhion of our Age, nor even of a better then ours. For Antiquity ha's complain'd before us of a certain art of <hi>Difficulty</hi> which great ones practice in the doing of good offices to enhance their price. They would have not onely Petitions and ſollicitations from their ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, but if they durſt, even be propitiated with Hymnes and Sacrifices. You act, My Lord, by principles more humane, and yet withall more noble. The obligation I have received comes ſo immediately from your ſelfe, that I did not ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute my deſires to it, but you were pleaſed to prevent them. What I conceive I am bound to aſſure you of, in teſtimony of my gratefull reſentments, is this, my Lord; that I receive the obligation with all its circumſtances, and there is no part of it, to which I have not an eſpeciall regard. I am not ignorant,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170361:19"/> that in theſe dayes Philoſophers are but little uſefull to the State; or to learne what reaſon perſons that are farre diſtant from the verge of the Court, have to hope for any influences from it. I ſee that favours are diſtributed with much frugality: And the Aſtrologers have inform'd me of a mortall conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Heavens, that hangs over the moſt deſerved penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Theſe conſiderations made me reſolve to have nothing, nor deſire nothing: and I commended the good mannagement of him that did at firſt refuſe me with ſcurvy Tickets. But, My Lord, you have corrected the Malignity of the Aſpects, and qualifi'd the Influence of the ſtarres, in my favour. You were pleas'd, to exempt me, by the prudence of your Conduct, from being involv'd in the calamities of the times, and partaking in the common loſſes. What ſhall I adde further? You have either recover'd one from death, or raiſed that which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dead. For in effect, I began to reckon my annuall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance in the number of things paſt, and to ſtyle it, My penſion of happy memory. After my conſideration and aſtoniſhment at theſe evenements, all that I can do is to proclaime the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to bleſſe the hand that wrought it, and to proteſt to you with the zeale and devotion of a ſoul ſenſibly oblig'd, that I eternally am,</p>

I owe you new acknowledgments for a new favour; for which I ſhould endeavour a retribution, if it were poſſible for my gratitude to be as ingenuous, as your goodneſs; and I had the gift to embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh fine language, as you have the art of adding value and richneſſe to gold.

They come not oftner then Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Feſtivalls; and though you oblige me every day in the place where you are, yet there needs a whole twelve months time to ſend you one bare thanks from hence. It is not that I begin to be a frugall husband of my words, after a ſquandring away of whole Volumes; and that I am growne Covetous of that only Eſtate I am thought to be rich in: But Madam, this eſtate being no more but the figure of ſound, proceeding from the mouth, and the iſſue of a ſmall emotion of the braine, I am aſhamed that I am not able to preſent you with that which may properly be called <hi>Some thing;</hi> and it vexes me alwayes to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my zeal, only to let you know it is unprofitable. To what purpoſe do we truck with our proteſtations and drive a trade with our wiſhes? And to what end is it to expoſe to ſale that which we want, and to enhance what we deſire to gaine? to put our ſelves in the high ſtraine onely to get a reputation to our poverty, and to guild the front of a Cottage made of earth and ſtubble? It is certainly farre better to ſay nothing with ſilence, then to ſay nothing in long harangues and diſcourſes. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Madam, you have a better opinion of an inſolent man

                  <p>NEither my ſelfe nor my affaires are worth the trouble you take upon you. When you have an opportunity to oblige me, you think nothing beneath you: And you who are the moſt moderate perſon in the world do herein commit exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances.

I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend, Madam, how this perſon could receive ſuch an honour, without deſcending from his high termes, and ſeeking their pardon by giving me immediate ſatisfaction. But there are a ſort of ſouls, whoſe hardneſſe is proofe againſt all ſoft perſwaſions: there is a Colony of Savages planted about <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> that underſtand nothing either <hi>Faire</hi> or <hi>Honest;</hi> neither Hiſtory, Oratory, the Muſes or <hi>Apollo.</hi> Complements make no impreſſion upon them, and they would reſiſt even the power of Exorciſmes.

You can do, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, all that you promiſe me, to get my buſineſſe effected ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. Your goodneſſe is ingenious, ready and powerfull to oblige me, but I have already received the greateſt obligation from you that poſſibly I can. For it is certaine giving me money would have been much leſſe, then contributing of your patience

                  <p>LEt the curioſity of people be as diligent and as laborious as they pleaſe, there can never be found odours that may be paralleld to thoſe which you inſpire into your ſweet bags. The moſt ſubtle eſſences of Rome have a mixture of <hi>terra damnata</hi> and impurity, in compariſon. The Spaniſh perfumes are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticate, and hurt more then they delight. Theſe are all pure and innocent, quickning and recreating the heart after they have flattered the brain and reviv'd the ſpirits. They may be called a Maſterpiece of Delicacy and Phyſick united. I may ſay that by your favour there remaines no ſort of honeſt and ingenious pleaſure undiſcover'd: and yet I may proceed further, that if you were Queen of <hi>Arabia the happy,</hi> or the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Iſlands, you could not have preſented me with any thing worthier of thoſe two faire Kingdomes. It is true, Nature is the firſt which labours in the production of odours, but it is you who afterwards cultivate her fertility and put her eſtate to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. Though Amber, Jaſmin, and Orange flowers be in themſelves excellent, you raiſe them into a temper that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances the nobleneſſe of their being. Theſe exquiſite things attaine their perfection in your hands; you purge them from all the defects of their matter, and beſtow ſomething on them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what they receive from the Sun. So that though he ſhould come neerer us by I know not how many degrees, and had the ſame power at <hi>Sainctes</hi> that he hath at <hi>Memphis,</hi> yet he would ever ſtand in need of your art.

If it be ſo, Sir, I beſeech you, let this poore Oratrix experienſe that your friendſhip is no unprofitable happineſſe, and that my recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, ſhall not diſadvantage a good cauſe. She is perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the moſt notorious Barreter of our Country, and I do not think there ever came a more formidable one out of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy. His very name makes the Widdowes tremble and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans runne away; there is no parcell of meadow or vineyard within three leagues of him ſecure to the poſſeſſor.

He is, poſſibly, proceeded from one of leſſe tyrannicall principles.

I will believe, you will not be backward to ſupply me with your aſſiſtance herein; you have ever uſed ſo unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a goodneſſe in my behalfe, that I cannot apprehend any niggardiſe, or cloſeneſſe from that very ſoul which I have found liberall even to profuſion. Do by me Sir, as you are uſed to do; and perſevere to oblige me in a ſecond perſon. Love a man whom undoubtedly you will eſteem. The deſire he hath to but know you, proceedes from the skill he already hath of many rare things; but you are his laſt and higheſt Curioſity. He wiſhes this happineſſe, becauſe he thinks to meet with every thing in you; and that you have enough to latiate his appetite of knowledge: yet I do not entreate an abſolute abandoning of your ſelfe; your leiſure and our diſcretion muſt regulate the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours we expect from your goodneſſe.

                  <p>I Have a favour to requeſt of your Court, which your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I conceive, may procure me. 'Tis a longer Licence for Monſieur <hi>de</hi> —. His merit being ſo well known to you, I will not make a rehearſall to you, how he hath been continually in the ſervice above theſe ten yeares, and on his body beares honourable teſtimonies of his courage, I onely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you thus much, that he had ere this been on his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Army if I had not detain'd him faſt with all my ſtrength and imployed the utmoſt power that friendſhip gives me, to make him deferre his journey. His affaires are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, and of neceſſity require his preſence, that it would be the utter loſſe of them to abandon them in the condition they now are in; Neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>theleſſe this would not be enough to ſtay him, and being more ſenſible of the leaſt intereſt of Honour then of the moſt conſiderable buſineſſes he hath: were it not for this violence that I exerciſe upon him, he would break all other chaines that bind him, to arrive at his Charge, yet before the fifteenth of March. So that if any prejudice befall him for this ſtay whereof I am the Authour, you ſee clearly whom he hath reaſon to complaine of, and how little I ſhall be ſatisfied with my counſell, if it be of the nature of thoſe medicines that corrupt the <hi>Liver,</hi> when they comfort the <hi>stomack;</hi> and if I could not propound him the conſervation of one thing without the ruine of another. Wherefore, Sir, it is as well for the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of my own judgment, which is engaged in the advice I have given him, as for contenting a perſon whom I love no leſſe then my ſelfe, that I importune you not onely for your favour, and your good offices (which I know are very prevalent with his Highneſſe the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>) but your expedients, and <hi>contrivances,</hi> which I am confident, are moſt dextrous and effectuall in all kind of affaires now. Beſides that the rigour of the Law does in ſome caſes admit mitigation, and juſtice does not exclude mercy, there is nothing impoſſible for a prompt and intelligent head (as yours is) that can profitably employ induſtry, when it is fitting to be ſparing of Authority; and reſcue that by ſome <hi>By-way,</hi> which would be otherwiſe loſt at Common Law. Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — when he preſents you this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170361:23"/> Letter, will conferre with you more particularly upon this ſubject: and offer you his opinion what wheeles are to be ſet on work, to make his friends buſineſſe feazible. I beſeech you once more to undertake it for my ſake, and if you conceive my name of any power in your mouth, or that it were known enough to be alledged to his Highneſſe, I durſt engage he ſhould not have cauſe to repent of granting me a favour, which I ſhould trumpet out ſo loud, and ſend ſo farre, that, it may be, Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity would thank him for it. It is a great while ſince I have had a high Veneration, of that Prince as one of the demi-gods of my Cabinet. But if he deſires I ſhould beare a more tender and ardent paſſion towards him; if he would be the object of my love, as he is of my Eſtimation; how delightfull would it be to me to terme him my Benefactour, and receive ſomething from a perſon, whom I ſhould not ceaſe to admire, though he ſhould take away all I have. I wiſh him Lawrells alwayes greene and freſh; and if the Warre muſt end, a long and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enjoyment of the pureſt fame that ever was; and a Glory that even the Enemy ſhall acknowledge, with generall accord by the very Hiſtories of Spaine.

                  <p>MY firſt deſigne is altered by the arrivall of Monſieur <hi>de</hi> —. I was about to have made a requeſt to you, and he informed me that I owed you a thanks. I underſtood from him, that he had found you ſo diſpoſed to oblige me, that all his Rhetorick lay on his hands. He told me too, that even Monſieur <hi>de Thou</hi>'s great name was uſed to you unneceſſarily. In fine, Sir, I knew, that I needed onely to have employed my ſelfe, to do my ſelfe any good offices with you. I am very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to be ſo much conſidered in a place, where I thought I was ſcarce known, and to find my ſelfe all at once in your good opinion where you ought not to have afforded me a room untill after a long tryall of my ſervice. But I ſee clearly from whence all this proceedes. Rigorous juſtice is ſeldome coupled with perfect Generoſity: this laſt, which is properly their own,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170361:24"/> is more impatient to produce her effects and leſſe regular in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving formalities. She would not be, as now ſhe is, the hon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>our of your owne Province, nor celebrated in all others, did ſhe ſo ſcrupulouſly attend deſert: ſhe will oftentimes prevent it, and I am one of the examples of this happy unworthyneſſe: you have rewarded my good intention, and anſwered my very thoughts, as Heaven anſwers the religious ſilence of people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth. You promiſed me that which I had not ſo much as asked for; but yet having promiſed it to me after ſo handſome a manner, you give me courage to requeſt it of you more vigour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly though my whole library ſhould reproach me for it. I will not ſtick to ſay, that my Niece became obliged to you for the conſervation of her juſt right, I ſhall alſo be obliged to you for that which was only wanting to the tranquillity of my life. Though Philoſophy promiſed me it, yet ſhe alone is not able to preſent me with it, nor appeaſe my diſquiets; but by ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping me of my deareſt affections, that would be too high an act of cruelty. Lay hold therefore on this advantage which you have over her, that I may owe you my repoſe for protecting the affections ſhe had deſerted; and that my contentment proceed from your courteſie, and not from the ſtrength of my imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I hope all good ſucceſſe by all the faire prefages you have given my friend; and if the deſtiny of a cauſe may be read in the eyes of a judge, he doth not any whit doubt the event of this he counſells me. Therefore to end, as he preſcribed me to begin, and ſince I am already in your chaines; ſince I am already faſtned to you by this obligation, I will, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, onely continue to ſtyle my ſelfe,</p>

                  <p>YOur Letter of <hi>June</hi> was delivered me in the middle of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> and I anſwer it in a Condition more capable to move pitty, then conferre comfort. My old diſeaſes have of late aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail'd me, increas'd by a Meagrim which does ſo torment me, that it would be a wonder, if a griefe ſo neighbouring to the brain ſhould leave the faculties of it at liberty. I am confident your goodneſſe will pardon my weakeneſſe, and I hope you will not take it ill that in this generall diſſipation of my moſt reaſonable thoughts, I cannot make you equall returnes, but am forc't to ſend you droſſe for gold, and things of no eſteem, for things moſt excellent. It is ſufficient Sir that I am able highly to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew (as I do) the moſt eloquent and handſome dreſſe you are pleas'd to put on your ſadneſſe: Yet I muſt needs tell you, if it ſhould ſtill continue, though accompanied with all ſorts of Arguments, and Colours of Rhetorique, I would take upon me not to allow your perſeverance therein. I would know wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly what you meane by that magnificent aggravation of your misfortune, by that Art, and thoſe Ornaments you make uſe of in the ſetting forth your loſſe? Inſtead of letting it wax old, and dye with time, it ſeemes you ſeek to renew it, and feaſt your ſelfe with it every day; and whereas tis expected you ſhould by little and little blot it out of your mind, you would preſerve it freſh and ever new, that (if poſſible) by the moſt lively and laſting'ſt Colours it might be kept to eternity. But how can an eternity be looke for from the frailty of a picture, ſince we cannot meet with it in the ſtrength of marble? Years ſpoil and conſume it, it glitters finely, and then moulders into duſt, and returnes to its firſt nothing. It is from hence Sir, I find my greateſt advantage to aſſail you, and ſummon you to yield up to Reaſon. We have in our Friend loſt a moſt worthy Senatour, I confeſſe it. But the Senate it ſelfe ſhall be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170361:26"/> deſtroyed, and one day there ſhall be no more Counſellours of <hi>Paris,</hi> then <hi>Conſcript fathers</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Areopagites</hi> of <hi>Athens.</hi> We have in the ſame friend been deprived of a Mathematician, an Oratour, and a Poet: I confeſſe this too; but do not you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently know, man lives onely among caſualties and walkes onely upon ruines? How long is it, I beſeech you, Since Mathematicians, Oratours, Poets died? We ſhould accuſtome our ſelves to ſuch like accidents as theſe; they are as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient as the world, and yet we look on them as ſtrange things, and novelties of to day. Theſe are no Prodigies, they are very vulgar and ordinary; and he who ſaid <hi>There was none but the first death, and none but the first night that deſerved aſtoniſhment and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> ſpake a truth whereon we ought to reflect more then we do. Every thing without exception is condemned to the ſame puniſhment; and not onely Parliaments and Judges are things not immortall, but learning ſhall periſh as well as the learned; and the height of Aſtrologie ſhall be no more priviledged, then the lowneſſe of Grammar. God who will diſſolve the Heavens to build more beautifull ones, will not protect Globes and Aſtrolabes in the deſtruction of their object. He will not leave us any notion of our ſmall acquaintance here, in the happy <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> he prepares for us, becauſe we ſhall have no leiſure there to enjoy them: our felicity ſhall be altogether ſerious. He will aboliſh both Proſe and Verſe; he will put down Prayers and Hymnes, and all other imperfect formes of ſpeaking to him, and make way for a more noble and excellent manner of praiſing him. I cannot, then, think it ſtrange, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your exclamations ſay, that Artiſts and their works have an end, ſince the Arts themſelves as well as their inſtruments muſt find a period. But grant it were not ſo, yet me thinks Sir, this <hi>End</hi> is no ſuch horrible thing. I am ſo little at Amity with the world that I do not much deplore any whomſoever, for being no more in it. Theſe five and thirty yeares I have been tyred with it, and every thing in it diſpleaſes me: ſo that I murmur and exclaime againſt it. My friends are the only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in it, that are not diſtaſtefull to me; and I hope you take it not ill, that I put you in that Role, ſince with paſſion I am,</p>

                  <p>I Am alwaies concern'd in ſome trifling employment or other, ſo that I have neither buſineſſe nor leiſure. My unhappy fate hath impoſ'd this voluntary ſervitude upon me which moſt commonly takes me up in frivolous affaires, and prevents me in the diſcharge of my more neceſſary duties. This is the onely thing in my opinion, that can juſtifie my ſilence to you, and oblige you to pitty, inſtead of Condemning me; I have owed you a Letter a great while, and the newes of Monſieur <hi>de Pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſk's</hi> death would require ſomething more of me, if I ſhould take counſell of my firſt ſuggeſtions, and act according to the uſuall Cuſtome. But all good offices are not to be done to all kind of perſons. It would be an affront to Philoſophy and a doubting the profeſſion you make of it, to treat you like vulgar men. I remember <hi>Seneca</hi> ſometimes comforted women and a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but I do not obſerve that any body undertook ever to comfort <hi>Seneca.</hi> I aſſent to you concerning whatſoever they ſpeak moſt highly and magnificently of your friend? and if you will allow me to make uſe in French, of a ſentence borrowed from Greece, I adde that we have loſt in that rare perſon, <hi>a piece of the wracks of Antiquity, and a relique of the Golden Age.</hi> All the vertues of Heroick times were retired into this lovely ſoul. The univerſall corruption had no power over the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Temper; and the evill that touch'd him, could not defile him. His generoſity was not bounded by the ſea, nor confin'd to this ſide the Alpes. He ſowed his favours and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities on all ſides; and had remerciments ſent him from the remoteſt corners of <hi>Syria</hi> and the top of Mount <hi>Libanus.</hi> In an indifferent fortune he had the thoughts of a great Lord, and never ceaſ'd to be a <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> although not ſupported by the amity of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> So that in this regard I ſhall not ſcruple to averre that he maintain'd the primitive ſplendour of gallantry in France, and the good eſteem that forreine nations do yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of her. I am of as certaine beliefe as you Sir, that he will be lamented of what ever is great and illuſtrious, reaſonable and intelligent, both within and without the Kingdome.

But concerning all theſe things which you write to me, far more eloquently then I am able to repeat, your diſcretion without doubt can afford your ſelf greater Conſolation then what you ſeeme to deſire from your friends. If your loſſe were not common to you with the <hi>noble Multitude,</hi> if both <hi>ſoveraignes</hi> and <hi>people</hi> were not intereſted in your griefe, it might be thought almoſt inſupportable; but ſince there's no body but beares his part with you, certainly there is a great deal of ſweetneſſe in an affliction that makes all the world on your ſide; nay ſhould you eſteem your ſelfe unhappy in this reſpect, it could not but be with ſome kind of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. There is, in earneſt, I know not what that pleaſes in the very wounds of this nature: when <hi>Princes</hi> are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd with <hi>private perſons,</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> joynes with the <hi>Country</hi> in the ſame fellowſhip of ſadneſſe, why ſhould we nitty or lament? It is a <hi>funerall,</hi> little leſſe ſplendid then a <hi>Triumph</hi> the praiſes and acclamations abroad take away all the bitterneſſe of dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique Complaints; and me-thinks, the poſſeſſion of that Glory, which cannot be aſcertain'd but by death is very well worth three or four ſcurvy yeares that might have been annexed to old age. To this glory if I could contribute any thing I ſhould eſteem my ſelfe happy, and towards this I offer you my hands and labour, though I cannot erect either Coloſſus'es or Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides? yet, Sir, without offence to thoſe who have a larger, and more ſublime fancy, who would ſet whole Foreſts and Mountaines on work. I have heard that ſome Artiſts have wrought in little, with much commendation; It is poſſible to be famous for ones Art, and not be prodigall of the Materialls: a great deale of matter may be comprehended in a few words, which by a long diſcourſe is enervated. There are bad <hi>Preachers</hi> and ſcurvy <hi>funerall Orations</hi> enough in the world already. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you let not me increaſe the number, and be one of thoſe officious enemies, who thus with a good intention injure the patience of the Living, and memory of the dead. I have too great an Ambition of pleaſing you, to give my ſelfe the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or runne the hazzard of diſturbing your quiet. And if you were indiſpoſ'd, I do not ſet ſo high a rate on my medicines to make experiments on ſuch a ſoul as yours. Take it not ill then I beſeech you, that I obey you after another faſhion then you

                  <p>IF I had known of your loſs earlier, I ſhould ſooner have ſhewen you what a part I beare in your griefe. I juſt now underſtood the cauſe of it in the Gazette, and make no queſtion, how ſtrong and how fortified ſoever you be with Conſtancy, but that you are ſenſible of the blow your family hath received, and which will be felt all over our Province. Without injury to nature, reaſon cannot rank ſuch like Accidents in the number of things Indifferent. Tenderneſſe of heart is not incompatible with greatneſſe of ſpirit; for thoſe who have undauntedly ſeen their own blood trickle down, yet have with teares bewail'd their kindred and friends in that Condition. Well, Sir, we muſt not think to make war, upon other termes: There was ever mourning and teares, even on the ſide of victory. Let us hope to recall him home who gives us occaſion to ſpeak ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of it, and let us not ambition the Empire of the World, at the rate of ſo deare a life as his. You muſt in this life a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is a perpetuall reaſon of Content and cauſe of ſatisfaction, that there is no colour why you ſhould grieve for any one; or any lament you. Yet, I do it, Sir, in obedience to cuſtome; knowing withall that that part of the ſoul, which ſuffers, is ſtrucken ſooner, then that which Reaſon hath warded off the blow. I thought it was neceſſary for me to enter into the ſame thoughts with you, but that it was as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary too, to get out of them; and by a way which without doubt your ſelfe had made choice of. I will hope that hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you will poſſeſſe all your joyes pure, and ſerene; and that Heaven, who loves you, reſerves ſucceſſes for you, wherein your Moderation ſhall be more requiſite, then your Conſtancy:

When I parted from you, I left you in the beſt plight, the ſtudy of wiſedome could ſettle a mind perfectly reaſonable; and the Letter you did me the honour to write to me, informes me of nothing that ſhould not continue you in this good temper. Nevertheleſſe, I confeſſe that ſentence of ſadneſſe among the reſt runnes in my mind. And in truth it would trouble me if ſo drowzy and effeminate a paſſion as that is, ſhould encroach upon your vigilance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. I remember the ſage diſcourſe you held me in, when your wound was yet greene; ſure you have not forgotten the great Precedent you then propounded, and what was ſo ready in your memory at the day of our ſeparation. They who bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed us thoſe high examples, concerning which we held ſo long a conference; were not happy or unlucky but in the good or bad fortune of the Common-wealth. They bare ſo great a love to their Country, that they left none for themſelves. They knew no dyſaſters b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I Have no great inclinations to ſerve you in your requeſt. I know not how to bewaile a man who hath gotten ſo much honour as you. You are more fit for Brave mens envy, then Philoſophers compaſſion: and your laurells are much more delicate, then your chaines: a ſtubborne Impriſonment is not ſo great an evill as you imagine it: it gives ill influences lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to paſſe over you: it reſerves a man to a happier ſeaſon; and, it may be, we ſhould have loſt you, if our enemies had not preſerv'd you. As concerning the Brimmers of <hi>Germany,</hi> of which you ſpake to me with ſuch griefe, as if they were Turkiſh baſtinadoes; me-thinks, your ſobriety is there a thought too ſuperſtitious. You muſt (as they that talk proverbs ſay) when you are at <hi>Rome,</hi> do as they do at <hi>Rome,</hi> and not to alledge to you great Commanders.

I preach not ſtedfaſtneſſe to a man who hath kept himſelfe upright more then once in the publique ruines, and hath afforded us examples. You are he that I would be;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170361:30"/> and Monſieur <hi>Huggens</hi>'s <hi>Constanter</hi> (which he took for his Motto becauſe his name was <hi>Constantine</hi>) belongs to you much more juſtly, then if you had only a title to it by vertue of an alluſion to your name.

But ſince he is afraid to trouble me with unneceſſary Letters, me thinks, I ought to have as great a reſpect to his buſineſſe, as he hath indulgence to my ſloath; and then I ſhall do diſcreetly, by not putting my ſelfe to trouble nor him. About five or ſix months ſince, he ſent me the Plat-forme of a Palace that he hath builded, and write me word that he was providing me an apartment there. Since I am ſo unfortunate that I am not able to crawle ſo farre as to Saint <hi>Bris</hi> to tender my reſpects to you, ſure, I ſhall hardly get over ſea to take poſſeſſion of the <hi>lodging</hi> prepared for me.

                  <p>I Underſtood from a friend of mine newly come out of <hi>Holland,</hi> of the loſſe you lately receiv'd before <hi>Breda,</hi> but judging of your griefe according to my acquaintance with your diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not doubting but it is much greater then ordinary, I dare not preſume to apply any thing to it. Theſe are maladyes to which forraine medecines are not to be apply'd, ſince they commonly prove but ineffectuall. It is poſſible a man may not weep with you; but it is impoſſible to condemne your teares. The auſtereſt Philoſophers do here ſuſpend the ſeverity of their Decrees: and <hi>Zeno</hi> would be worſe then <hi>Phalaris,</hi> if amidſt the tyranny he exerciſes over humane paſſions, he were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to naturall piety. So that, Madam, none hath any title to comfort you but your ſelfe: you alone are capable to do that good office to your ſelfe, and manage that affliction which I look upon with amazement. I am confident, you will be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull in it: for knowing very well that there is as much fortitude as tenderneſſe in your ſoul, I do not believe that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the courſe of things, you would have fortitude ſubmit, and the weaker get the maſtery of the ſtronger. Heretofore I have heard you valew life ſo little, that by your own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples it were no great misfortune to do dead. And though you may have renounced this opinion, yet you will grant that the abſence which ſeperates thoſe who live, from thoſe who live no more, is too ſhort a thing to merit any long bemoaning. The cauſe of obſtinate griefes cannot be juſtified but by preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an eternity in this life, or a deſpaire of that which is to come. But the very example of the perſons we bewaile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes the firſt ſuppoſition, and the laſt is inconſiſtent with the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170361:32"/> promiſes of the ſonne of God. So that, Madam, I ſhould not only forget the common Fundamentalls of our Faith, if I ſhould comply with the perſiſtance of your ſadneſſe: but on the other ſide ſhould forget that I deal with a Lady, who is able to read excellent lectures of wiſedome to Men; and with a Mother who gives not precedence in point of courage and Magnanimity to all the Matrons of <hi>Lacedemon?</hi> I will onely therefore repreſent to you, to baniſh vulgar thoughts out of your head, that it is not in vaine, we call you <hi>Heroine,</hi> and beſides to give ſatisfaction to truth and my affection, that it is impoſſible but I muſt be ſick of all your griefes, being, as I am, withall my ſoul,</p>

You comfort me Sir, and that moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, for all the time and paper which hitherto I thought loſt: For now though I have taken pains only for an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Court, and inſenſible Grande's, yet ſince you prize my pains at ſo high a rate, I look for nothing from any body: you have paid me what others did apparently owe me. Can it be, that I not only take up your ſpare hours, but cure your ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and that ſuch trifles as were only the paſtime of the idle, are become remedies for the afflicted?

                  <p>THe man ſo much ſpoken of to me is in this country, and we have already met three or four times. I have ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him withall my might: I have laboured as much as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to blot out his unſound opinions, but I proteſt his reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is greater then my ſtrength, and you may tell our friends of <hi>Thoulouze</hi> that I have loſt my paines and my argumentations. There is no way to make him approve of Lent, as well becauſe of the preaching in it as the faſting. He judges all Preachers by two or three Hedge-Prieſts that he hath heard, and fancies that all ſermons begin either with <hi>The valiant Captain Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> or <hi>The learned Philoſopher Socrates,</hi> or, <hi>Pliny in his naturall History,</hi> or <hi>Pauſanias in Arcadicis:</hi> he urges to me continually the <hi>Buon per la Predica,</hi> and the <hi>Riſervate queſto per la Predica</hi> of the Cardinall <hi>Hippolitus</hi> of <hi>Este,</hi> when any merry fellow of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars ſpoke impertinently before him. He doth not forget the <hi>Mortalium ineptiſſimus, excepto uno Panigarolâ.</hi> He paraphraſes and comments upon theſe precepts that an old Doctour gave a young Batchelour; <hi>Percute Cathedram fortiter; respice crucifixum torvis oculis, et nihil dic ad propoſitum, et bene praedicabis.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, that it is not juſt to conſider things in that corruption
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170361:35"/> they were once plunged into, ſince now they are re-eſtated in their primitive purity: and reformation hath ſucceeded diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I lay before him when it comes to my turne, the merit of our <hi>Chryſostomes,</hi> and <hi>Baſils:</hi> but he replyes to me againe, that according to my uſuall cuſtome I am liberall even to Prodigality, and that I beſtow great words and illuſtrious titles on every day in the year. He maintaines that thoſe good Fathers, are dead long ſince without iſſue. If he could, he would introduce the Greek cuſtome into the Latin Church: he would have ancient Homilyes read to the people, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition to make new ones for them. If he durſt, he would do all his devotions in his Study, and be auditour to none but his books. What is to be done with this petulant moroſe fellow, this head ſtrong opinative man, this ignorant pretender to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? It comes in my head to ſhew him that admirable <hi>Extract</hi> which you ſent me, and I do not think it will be any hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to put that off to him for a tranſlation of a Greek Father which was preached at St. <hi>John en Greve;</hi> yea for a Father of the firſt <hi>Claſſis</hi> in both Churches.

You will receive by Monſieur your Secretary the papers of that gentleman, that writes ſo excellently, and yet cannot ſpell; that ſo happily makes uſe of the higheſt figures of Rhetorique, and yet never learnt ſo much as the Elements of Grammar. He is ignorant of the uſe of comma's and points, yet never failes to make moſt ceven and juſt periods. He familiarily puts a great Letter down where there ſhould be a little one, and never knew the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Kit and Chitte. If he write to his miſtris in the City concerning Hearts or Haires, you would take him for a woodman; for you ſhall ſee nothing but Harts and Hares. Had he gotten his learning at the Univerſity by the uſuall wayes, he would be no greater a ſcholler then other men are: he might be ſought for among the crowd of thoſe Sir Dominies, whereof there are legions in every province of this Kingdome. But you will grant me that he is remarkeable by his ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that his defect of Latin, and ſcarcity of ſuch like forraine

This good newes found me in ſo ill a condition, that you ſee I have been neceſſitated theſe two months to deferre my congratulations of it. I had Winter and all her Clouds in my head. I had neither a diſtinguiſhable voyce, nor an articulate ſound. I was only able to grumble and murmur —.

To cloathe them in ordinary words were too great an abaſement of them: and in conſcience I never had more need of that officious figure which aides our good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which diſchargeth the poor mans debts, and, not content to deſcribe things to their juſt value, doth inhaunce them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely above themſelves. You are acquainted with it, Madam, under the famous name of Hyperbole; and I muſt confeſſe to you I have poorly abandon'd it almoſt eighteen yeares ago, out of a cowardly fear which the reproaches and calumnies of my enemies created in me, without Queſtion very much to my diſadvantage: for I eaſily foreſee, that wanting its ſuccour to thank you magnificently, as I deſired, I muſt be conſtrained to ſerve my ſelfe of the ſimplicity of my mother tongue, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tell you, as another mortall would, that I am highly obliged to you for your Preſent: yet I will adde, Madam, but in the extreameſt rigour and ſeverity of truth, That the only news of this Preſent, hath intirely changed the face of my fortune, and ſeems to have placed aboundance where before was poverty. If you pleaſe, I ſhall take the Liberty to expound my meaning, and render you an account of the preſent eſtate of my affaires: 'Tis moſt certain, the wrath of Heaven is this year fallen upon our Country; and that for my own particular, I have not been more favourably treated then my neighbours. But though the unſeaſonable haile and froſt in the month of <hi>May,</hi> have ſaved us the labour of gathering our Vintage in <hi>September,</hi> and left us nothing but the ſad remainders of their prey; though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing eares of corne have deceived our expectation, and yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an inconſiderable harveſt, (I demand your pardon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam for theſe village expreſſions) though on the other ſide, all the Avenues of the Exchequer are moſt ſtrictly guarded and juſteſt gratifications eſcape not from it but with difficulty; yet for my own part I am nothing ſenſible of all theſe bad conſequences; they are misfortunes that concerne not me; and you, madam, are alone the cauſe that I complain not either of the inclemency of heavens, the barrenneſſe of the earth, or the covetouſneſſe of the State. By meanes of you, never year was more plentifull, nor more happy to me then this: for having loſt ſomewhat in ignoble and common things, may I not be

                  <p>TO obey you, I have read the Spaniſh Philoſopher's Book a ſecond time. The title alwayes pleaſed me excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; but I cannot ſay any more of the reſt, then what I told a Gentleman of my familiaritie, who firſt mention'd it to me. I could not find what I ſought in it, and in my opinion the <hi>Art of the Will</hi> required all the ſufficiencies of our <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> to be diſplay'd anſwerably to its merit. The Spaniard is in many places enervate and feeble, in others too ſubtile and abſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and repeates the ſame matter ſo often, that his ſixe Books might be reduc'd to leſſe then the halfe of that number with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any injury to his ſubject. A moderne Oratour termed this kind of <hi>Tautologie, The dancing the Canaries in a Buſhell.</hi> And a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of antiquity ſaid it was,
<q>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num ponere ferculis tot aſſem.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which may be expreſſed in ordinary ſpeech, The ſerving up of one joynt in a dozen or two of diſhes. But I beſeech you Sir, what ſiniſter advice, what viſion or extravagance mov'd this <hi>John Euſebius</hi> to cite almoſt perpetually, ſuch authors as have no authority; and were ſcarce ever heard of? This is giving people for ſureties, for whoſe credit certificates and pledges, yea pawns and engagements of bodies, might be required in their particular affaires. I cannot tell what ranke a <hi>Bernardus Sylveſter,</hi> a <hi>Barlaamus Giracenſis,</hi> or an <hi>Odo Cluniacenſis,</hi> ſhould hold among the genuine and legitimate Fathers of the Church. His treatiſe beares the Character of the ſame judgement throughout. All the way he ſtraines his wits in queſt of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous novelties both in things and words, that he may ſeem to renounce the dialect of the Schools, and to ſpeake like a man of another Country, he compounds ſuch a gibberiſh of his own as farre exceeds the obſcurity and canting of the Doctors, and is likewiſe no leſſe ſavage and remote from the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170361:43"/> Romane purity. He himſelf is the Planter of his barbariſm and raiſes a new rebellion of his own head againſt <hi>Cicero.</hi> And this with how much indeavour and violence? His care and paines are perſpicuous in the defects of his ſtyle. He deſignes to fall, where other men ſlip unwittingly. He do's not utter his Galamaufry unawares, but 'tis his ayme to plunge himſelf into it. In a word, intending to ſpeak elegantly, he ſpeaks ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly with curioſity, and makes choice of all his bad expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Could it poſſibly be, that this man had the liking of <hi>Meſſieurs Du-Puy.</hi> I do not believe he is of any great credit with the Jeſuits; I mean, the Jeſuits of <hi>Paris,</hi> who have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pallat then thoſe of <hi>Madrid.</hi> I am confident, that in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular at leſt the dreadful <hi>Petavius</hi> is of the ſame opinion with the redoubtable <hi>Salmaſius.</hi> Inſtead of him I read the life of your <hi>Mamurra</hi> without wearineſs. It ſeems to me more lovely and new, at the tenth reading then at the firſt. How heartily it would have provok'd the laughter of the Cardinal of <hi>Perron?</hi> How wil it pleaſe the Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> and with what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem wil the father <hi>Strada</hi> regard the ſalt and delicate ſawces in it. He who ſometimes ſmiles after a Roman manner, and is as exquiſite at ingenious raillery as your ſelf: But if you would ſee the Elogium of his Life all at length, you may pleaſe to ſee what I have written of it to the father <hi>Socrates,</hi> and aske of him, if I commend the other Latine Satyres he ſent me with the ſame Language.</p>

                  <p>YOur judgment is true; the productions of theſe fine wits are neither free nor naturall. A ſtraining and forcedneſſe is diſcernable every where: and aiming to become admirable, they happen to be prodigious.

                  <p>I Applaud the deſigne you do me the favour to impart to me, and it will be approved all the world over, if you pleaſe to produce as fine things as you are able to expreſſe them elegantly. The ancient Latiniſm beares a high price amidſt the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm of theſe latter ages; but where it is quite dryed up (as in ſome places in which it is maintained meerly by the dint of talking) it is to write only for two or three in a kingdome, whoſe palates are capable of guſting any thing of ſound and ſincere antiquity. The curioſity of the major part muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with ſomething notorious and remarkable, that may ſtick in the memory, and not be blown away with the ſound of the words. And herein the Italian writer of Characters, is much more divertiſing and inſtructive, then he of France, though he is inferiour to him in Latin and Politeneſſe. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; is there not a great deal of delight in underſtanding the true manner of <hi>Politian's</hi> death, which Cardinall <hi>Bembo</hi> hath ſo diſguiſed in the Epitaph he made upon him? the whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey of <hi>Naugerius,</hi> in making an annuall ſacrifice of <hi>Martiall's</hi> Epigrammes to the muſe of <hi>Catullus;</hi> and the proud moroſities of another Poet of the ſame times? &amp;c. I adviſe you to excite the Readers attentiveneſſe by ſuch like particularities in the lives of your worthies. Uſe your utmoſt to interweave the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of Hiſtory with the purity of language, and do not forget to ſprinkle <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> ſalt, in the ſame feaſts where you uſe <hi>St. Martha's</hi> ſugar. If you do thus, you will compoſe a work that ſhall live; and will not deſerve meanly of your own Age, by obliging Poſterity.

Damſels, who have already wonne you ſo many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, and ſo many Readers of your works; bear ſome reſpect to the advantages of nature, I mean the gifts of God; and if you are not an Enemy to the harmleſs delights of our Country, do not do, like that extravagant Chaſte one, who mangled his face, becauſe his beauty pleaſed thoſe Eyes too well that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it.

                  <p>AFter I have told you, I was very ſenſible of the honour you did me, I muſt now adde, that I have a ſhare in that honour you have done to our Age; and that I ſhould have been unwilling to dye without ſeeing your labours in their utmoſt perfection. This work, Sir, will be no vaine ſhew of Science nor meer Ornament of Libraries: this will be a piece ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the order of things, for want of which the Glory of France was defective: it will at once both beautifie the publique, and ſtrengthen the State. Our Kings ſhall reckon it among their Demeanes, or put it into the number of their Treaſures: and if with your profound Learning you had not a large portion of humility you would give me leave to preferre it before Bucklers faln from Heaven, Images eſteemed fatall, and other ſacred Gages of the Grandure and Duration of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires; but you would not have men flye ſo high, for your ſake; and you do not affect to ſhew your ſelf in ſo much pompe. The Title you have given to your excellent Book is leſſe proud and figurative: it doth not menace the world with an inſolent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, though its modeſty (notwithſtanding) promiſe that which none but a perfect underſtanding can performe. You undertake, Sir, the difficulteſt accommodation that ever was heard ſpoken of, ſince there were any quarrels on Earth: and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170361:49"/> though Prieſthood and Royalty are two powers naturally friends, nay two daughters of the ſame Father, yet they are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo embroyled againſt one another by the intereſt of their relatives, that it will be hard for Equity her ſelf to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the reconciliation of them. To this is required a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the hot-headed French are not very inclinable to, and the haughty Roman, leſſe: here muſt be neither the ſpirit of a Slave, nor an Enemy: here muſt be a ſoul full of light, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of paſſion; the King's power muſt be acknowledged, and the Pope's authority bowed to: but truth, who is Superiour both to Pope and King, and is the ſtrongeſt thing in the world muſt be abſolutely depended on. What a Renoune will it be to you, when it is believed, that your deſigne was meerly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige her; and it ſhall be ſaid you defended her rights, as if you had received pay from her, or were by her comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to write books! What a brave thing it will one day be, to be ſtyled the <hi>Champion</hi> of truth? I do not ſee any thing in your writings that may prejudice your hopes, or ſo noble a pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If you had any ſuch when you writ it, there is nothing of the degenerate or rebell in it, and though as yet I have only conſidered the outſide of the building, and three or four pieces of the Portal, I omit not to comprehend the merit of the whole pile together. I ſaw at the firſt glance that your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is wiſe, your Libertie diſcreet, and your zeal not blind: the moſt part of books are notorious by ſuch imperfections, and the greateſt part of Readers will eaſily be cured of them, if they meet with no more books to foment them: for my part, I ſeek after nothing elſe, ſince my gray Haires admoniſhed me to look after what is ſolid and ſerious: but eſpecially, Sir, <hi>I</hi> highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem that learned wiſdome, without which I ſhould not value all <hi>Baronius</hi> Latin though he had mountaines of it, nor all <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaubon's</hi> Greek, though he were more Atticke then Athens it ſelf; nor all <hi>Scaliger's</hi> Hebrew and Arabick, though he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it better then the Rabbins, and the Mufty.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170361:50"/> the ſtyle of the place where you are: ſuch ſubmiſſions are part of your mirth, and at Court you play with thoſe words, which we uſe in earneſt in the Country. It muſt neceſſarily be ſo; elſe is it poſſible that you who are ignorant of nothing ſhould not know what your ſelfe were worth? Would you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted your ſelfe out of the univerſall knowledge you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and at once both obeyed and diſobeyed the Oracle of <hi>Apollo?</hi> In earneſt, after I had conſidered, examined, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died your book a whole fortnight, I concluded that never any knew the worth of a man ſo perfectly as your ſelf. Never was the God of <hi>Delphos</hi> more nobly, more punctually obeyed: No, not by him of whoſe abſolute wiſedome he gave teſtimony, nor him that was heretofore called <hi>The understanding:</hi> nor that other who to this day is called <hi>The Genius of nature.</hi> This Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, it is true, hath peeped into the ſoul, but he ſtopped at the doore. He hath only made the way open to you; and if I were bold enough, I would ſay, he is but of the outer Court, you of the Cabinet-councell. There is no receſſe nor cranny of the humane ſoul, but you have penetrated; there is nothing how nimble, ſwift or ſecret ſoever, that paſſes through it, can eſcape the perſpicacity of your ſight, and of which you cannot give a moſt faithfull and certaine account. Our greateſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers are only Pupills and Grammar Schollers of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as Euſtathius was of Homer, and Servius of <hi>Virgil.</hi> Our beſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne books are only repetitions and tranſcriptions of ancient ones, or at moſt, but Gloſſes and Paraphraſes on them. I ſhould wrong yours, if I ſhould ſay the ſame of it. I ſhould injure the higheſt and ſoveraigne Reaſon, which is intereſſed in this work, if I ſhould attribute it to the leſſons you had learned, or the common places you had collected. You are nothing leſſe then Commentatour or tranſcriber; and to put you in among the number of wits of the ſecond rank would be to degrade you. It may be ſaid then, and that without extravagancy, that you are Philoſopher in chiefe: that your writings are Originalls that you have made a great progreſſe into Truth; that you have there diſcovered unknown regions, which muſt beare your name, and the ſtrait of Magellan not more famous, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine places you have paſſed through. There is no queſtion but you are the firſt that travelled them, and therefore the glory of diſcovery is due to you. There are things in your book, for the invention of which a Grecian would have thanked his Gods with a Hecatombe. And not to particularize ſo many,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170361:51"/> (and thoſe ſo rare) things; That ſingle diſcourſe of the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Animals</hi> is a novelty would have given birth to a Sect at Athens, and have ranked you among the Founders of Philoſophicall Orders. If <hi>Aristotle</hi> himſelfe were returned to the world, ſo excellent a Novelty would ſtir up Jealouſie in his breaſt; it would vex him as much as it would inform him; for being ſo ambitious as he was, he would have been incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolable for not being the author of it. But in what unknown quarter of the World have you found that lovelineſs and light (which are wanting in his works) which invite, ſollicite, and arreſt all eyes to yours. <hi>Beauty</hi> is there inſeparably united with goodneſs. By your paines it is become broad day in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, after a night of many Ages; and your words are ſo clear and pure, ſo powerfull and efficacious, that farre from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuring things from quickeſt ſighted, me thinks they might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven illuminate the blind; as they diſplay the objects, they ſtrengthen and cheriſh the ſight, They delight both the ſevere and the <hi>ſad:</hi> and the pleaſure of them is ſuch that I make no Queſtion but an expreſſion ſo flouriſhing and attractive even in the Thornieſt and Rougheſt matters, would quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit Rome and make France loath Comedies and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuch other kind of allurements as voluptuous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are taken with. This being ſo, if I am not the moſt deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man in the world, and having written nothing but what proceeds from my very heart, and a full perſwaſion, I may yet come in earneſt to anſwer either, the Drollery or civilities of your Letter. In concluſion I ſay this, if you have loſt any thing by my abſence (as you pretend in complement) they are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable applauſes, loud and frequent acclamations, ſometimes interrupted with a ſilent pauſe of admiration: they are poſtures and geſtures of a man tranſported, and ſuch kind of things as Poſtes and Meſſengers are not laden with all: theſe, it may be, you have loſt; and in truth, I believe if I had been at <hi>Paris</hi> when your book came forth, the repreſentation of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> you are to treat of in your Chapter of Ecſtaſy might all have been ſeen acted by me, though I have not the gift to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them, as you have in paper: in which let it ſuffice to aſſure you, that I am paſſionately,</p>

                  <p>IT is enough, that I hear you have done me the honour to take cogniſance of my cauſe. After this, I do not expect till you have pronounced judgment, to give you thanks for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice you have done me. Favourable or contrary, I call it good becauſe, being yours it cannot be bad. And if I were afraid of the extreameſt rigour, as I hope ſomething more mild, yet I am too well perſwaded of the integrity and ſufficiency of my judg, not to approve my condemnation, if comming out of his mouth. In ſuch affaires, I will never appeal from you to any other. Neither the People, nor Poſterity, are names great enough to be ſet in the ſcale againſt <hi>Salmaſius;</hi> and if I ſhould ſay that in the Common-wealth of Letters he holds the ſame dignity that formerly Queen <hi>Zenobias</hi> Confident did, who was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Oracle of his own Age, and the Treaſure of paſt Centuries, I ſhould ſpeak nothing but what all the ſound part of that Republique would averre after me. Do you then Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignly decide, Sir, all the matters in conteſt? Your opinion ought to be the abſolute Rule of our differences. Againſt ſo legitimate an authority, there is no protection among the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins; no Sanctuary in the Eaſt, nor Recruit in the Country of the <hi>Helleniſts:</hi> and how ſmall an inclination ſoever my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſhews to an arbitrement like mine, yet we are each of us obliged to tell you, <hi>Tibi ſummum rerum judicium Dii dedêre, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis obſequii gloria relicta est.</hi> I ſhall conſerve this glory with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and continue paſſionately, whilſt I live,</p>

                  <p>YOu have not followed the advice of the Secretary of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> in the diſtribution of your favours. He would have counſell'd you to diſtill them drop by drop, to the end they might hold out the longer. But that Grandeur of courage of which you make profeſſion is above thoſe frugall Maximes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170361:52"/> it conferres its graces with a full and open hand; and you are of opinion you have given nothing, where you have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched. I have found in the ſame pacquet, your Letter, your Requeſt, your Tragedy, and your Obſervations upon the <hi>Kid.</hi> What an Ocean of favours pour d out at once! which had they been well husbanded, had returned you the incom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But I queſtion not; you were very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be quit of three bad Complements, and will receive this only in your own defence. And yet, Sir, I dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by it to be diſcharged of my debt: it ſhall ſerve to beare witneſſe againſt me how much I owe you, and let you know the deſart hath not yet render'd me ſo ſavage, but that I have ſome ſenſe left me of thoſe rarities which are brought me from the civilized world.

Few, if any, are ignorant of the merit of your verſe; and your proſe hath raviſh'd ſome who were not acquainted withall your perfections, which as it may boaſt an infinity of graces beſides thoſe of novelty, ſo it hath found in the world a vaſt number of partiſans, and adorers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom I am not the leaſt paſſionate.

However I muſt needs ſay, you ſeeme to me to have attacqued him with addreſſe and force; and that, for the moſt part, your objections are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſtrong ſenſe, with ſubtilty and gallantry it ſelfe.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170361:52"/> 
                     <hi>Italy,</hi> who hath not ſome fault to find, in the ſtructure of <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bleau,</hi> who doth not call it a Monſter of ſtone, and yet this Monſter is the faire habitation of our kings, and the Court is there commodiouſly lodged. There are many perfect beauties eclipſed, by others whoſe features carry in them leſſe of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but more of attract and charme. And ſince acquired parts are not ſo noble as the naturall, nor the induſtry of men to be equally eſteemed with the gifts of heaven, I may further adde that to underſtand the art of pleaſing is not ſo much to be val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued as to underſtand <hi>how without Art to pleaſe. Aristotle</hi> blames the <hi>Flower of Agathon,</hi> yet confeſſes it agreeable, and his <hi>Oedipus</hi> was not perhaps agreeable, though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> approved it. If it then be true, that the ſatisfaction of the ſpectators is the end which the Theater propoſeth to its ſelfe; and that the Profeſſors of that art have ſometimes appealed from <hi>Caeſar</hi> to the people; the <hi>Kid</hi> of the French Poet having pleaſed as well as the <hi>Flower</hi> of the Grecian, it muſt be granted he hath obtained the ſcope of his repreſentation, and that he hath already reach'd the goale, though he made not to it by the way of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> nor by the addreſſes of his <hi>Poeſy.</hi> But you will ſay, he hath caſt a Miſt before the eyes of the world, and will accuſe him of Magique and enchantment. I know many people that would have the vanity to be proud of ſuch an accuſation; and you your ſelfe will confeſſe to me that Magique were an excellent thing, if a thing that were lawfull. Would it not be admirable (think you) to be the Authour of innocent Prodigies? to make the ſunne appeare at midnight, to prepare a feaſt without meat or Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; to change oake leaves into Gold, and glaſſe into Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds? This is that with which you reproach the Authour of the <hi>Kid,</hi> who acknowledging himſelfe to have violated the rules of art doth oblige you at the ſame time to avow he hath a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret which hath thriven better with him then the Art it ſelfe; and not denying but he hath deceived all the Court and all the People, leaves you nothing to conclude but that he is more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till then all the Court and all the People, and that a fineſſe put upon ſo great a number of Perſons is more a conqueſt then a fraud. This being ſo, Sir, I doubt not but the Meſſieurs of the Academy will find themſelves in the briars about the deciding of your cauſe; and that on the one ſide, your Arguments will ſhake them; as on the other the publique approbation will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them. Were I of their number, I ſhould have been in the like paine, had I not by good fortune lighted on your ſentence
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170361:53"/> in the Regiſter of Antiquity. It was pronounced fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years agoe by a Philoſopher of the Stoique Tribe, but ſuch a Philoſopher who had a ſoul not inſenſible of pleaſures. The Satyres and Tragedies fallen from whoſe hand, we have yet amongſt us; one who flouriſhed in the reigne of an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour that was both a Poet and Comedian, in the Age of Verſes and of Muſique.

I cannot hate a perſon whom you love; and to tell you the truth, methinks he is grown more gentle and leſſe thorny, ſince he paſſed through your hands. The reaſon is, you contract no ſoile from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the matters which you handle; and amidſt the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Policy your morality is preſerv'd pure and unconcern'd. A Stoicall Philoſopher of this latter Age, as you will grant <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> to be, had the ſame paſſion as your ſelf: A great Commander, as queſtionleſs was the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola,</hi> hath tranſlated the ſame thing, into his own language; though it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was yet publiſhed; and I reveale this ſecret to you from the mouth of one of his greateſt Confidents.

                  <p>THe gentleman who delivered me your Letter, brings you the Sermons you would needs have me read, and of which you deſired my opinion. I have read them with a great deal of delight, and I may ſay with much edification: for, in earneſt, they do not deviate, me-thinks, from the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Doctrine; and were it not for two or three little marks, which denote them of the contrary party, and ſome ſlight offers at our Outſide, which we do not much care to defend, they might be preached with applauſe in our <hi>Ladies Church</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> I met with beauty in moſt places, and vigour almoſt in all; eſpecially in that of our dear Monſieur <hi>Daille.</hi> He is none of thoſe Oratours, <hi>Seneca's</hi> Apes, whoſe perpetuall Antitheſies only touch upon the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the ſoul. As he uſes better weapons then they, ſo he ſtrikes deeper wounds. He leaves true compunction in the heart, and not falſe allarmes in the eare.

                  <p>IT is now wedneſday morning, and you may keep Monſieur <hi>Godeau</hi>'s book till Friday Evening: but I declare to you, I
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170361:55"/> cannot reſolve to endure a longer abſence. Do you know how much I do in this for your ſake? I ſeperate my ſelfe from a friend at all houres of the day; I deprive my ſelf of a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that makes my ſolitude happy; I let go a gueſt that payes me in Rubies and Diamonds. It is true, he will returne ſpeedily: but in the meane time, what a Patience muſt I practiſe to be without him to day, to morrow, and the next day? When you have ſurveyed the wonders I ſpeak of, you will accuſe my words of undervalewing and pooreneſſe: you will deride the meaneneſſe of my Metaphors, though I draw them from the moſt precious things Magnificence can be imploy'd in, and make them of Rubies and Diamonds. You will tell me, that in this inferiour world, and amongſt all the glories of nature that are viſible, no compariſon is to be found worthy of my friend: that he is an Angell in a Poets diſguiſe; that he is deſcended to Earth to teach men the language and Muſick of Heaven: at leaſt let us ſay, and that with a perfect conſent and wonder, that before him our Muſes were Courteſans, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched wenches, and he hath reclaimed them from that ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous life, to make them Saints and Religious, like you: let us ſay, he hath reduced Verſe to its primitive and Legitimate uſe: that he hath cleanſed <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> when it was filled with all the defilements of humane wit, with the mudde and the corruption of all ages. But what ſhould not I ſay in a Preface of my making, before the book I ſend you, ſince I have made a Ticket ſpeak ſo much already? One word more in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your Letter. Pardon me, Madam my deareſt Colen, if I cannot do what you entreat me. I do not think I ſhall quit St. <hi>John Chryſostome,</hi> nor St. <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope, who are the Chaplains of my Deſart, for your Preacher, to whoſe Sermons you invite me. And unleſſe your ſelfe were to preach in your own Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, it would be a very difficult task to entice me out of my Hermitage as long as this faire ſeaſon laſts. Do not think I am in jeſt when I ſpeak of your Preaching: you want nothing to do it but a priviledge, which by misfortune hath not been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your ſexe: and you would have eloquence to ſpare, if the Church would ſuffer you to make uſe of it. I wiſh you a good day, and am with all my ſoul,</p>

                  <p>I Received your Paraphraſe on the Canonicall Epiſtes: But you are more liberall then you conceive you are, or elſe you give more then you ſpeak of. The Letter you did me the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to write me, promiſes me only four Apoſtles, and I find five in the book I received from your favour. Was it for want of memory that you made no mention of the fifth, or an exceſſe of humility that you reckoned it for none? This it ſelfe is one of the marks of Apoſtleſhip; and the ſame God who exalts thoſe of your order in the ſame rank with Angells, by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he hath given them, inclines them to debaſe themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath men, by the example he hath left them. But I am not obliged ever to aſſent to your Humility, and believe a perfect man that preaches his imperfection. For not to put any diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Saints that triumph above, and thoſe who fight below, I believe I may ſay, the ſame ſpirit that animates you, is no other but that which inſpired them, and that you ſpeak with as much vigour as our <hi>Fathers</hi> did when the blood of our Saviour boiled yet in the Churches veines. I obſerve in your works the language of thoſe Heroick times, and the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of thoſe <hi>Heroes.</hi> Though I am all ice, I kindle at the reading of them; and I ſhould find no difference between the Epiſtle you have made, and thoſe you have expounded, but that you call them <hi>Gentlemen</hi> whom the Apoſtles ſtyle <hi>Brethren.</hi> But it is not through affectation of certain termes out of uſe, that we are to imitate the primitive Chriſtians. There is no great harme in complying with the age we are of, in things of ſo ſmall conſequence; and without letting ſlack the antient auſterity, ſome little toleration may be yielded to cuſtome.

                  <p>YOur papers have taught me an infinity of good things, both ſerious and delightfull, ſtrong and ſubtle, Attick and Roman in an equall degree: but this ſhall be our Sundayes converſation, and I will not dilate my ſelf on it till I am with you in attending that deſired day. I muſt tell you newes, that Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — who was ſo much your friend, is become your accuſer: In earneſt, he impeached you yeſterday for a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and he ſtill averres that there is ſomething ſupernaturall in your more then <hi>Ovidian</hi> ſmoothneſſe. He ſweares that that of the Prophets and other inſpired perſons, nay that of <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelfe their inſpirer, was never comparable. For my part, I dare not go ſo high: I only ſay, that when you ſpeak in Proſe, you are more puzzelled to avoid meaſures, and number, then we are to find them when we write Verſes. I believe it would be no hard task for you to turne all into rime, that ever was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170361:56"/> written in the world, and ſet all the Sciences in muſicke: that hereafter, Philoſophy and Divinity, yea the Law, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick too, might be all ſung of your compoſing. There is no Authour ſo conſtant and ſtiffe in his way, but alters in your hands; none ſo ſerious and ſad but you make him dance as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as you pleaſe. There is no mortall in Print, but you in an inſtant teach him the Language of the Gods, by an extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Paraphraſe. You have already written a Rhetoricke in Verſe; but that is nothing, you will make <hi>Cicero</hi> a Poet when you pleaſe; his <hi>Orations</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles</hi> ſhall be transformed into <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Epigrames,</hi> if you reſolve it.</p>

If the word <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitate</hi> is not yet a French Denizen, it ſhall be next year, and Monſieur <hi>de Vaugelas</hi> hath promiſed not to oppoſe it. I congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate your good fortune in <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and confeſs you have cauſe to ſlight the three Cities you ſpeak of; though <hi>Venice</hi> be Queen of the Sea, <hi>Rome</hi> Metropolis of the earth, and <hi>Madrid</hi> be accuſed of aſpiring to the Univerſall Monarchy. If the man of <hi>Bilbilis</hi> ſaid formerly to a <hi>Caliſta</hi> of leſs merit then yours, <hi>Romam tu mihi ſola facis,</hi> what would he not have ſaid,

A little World ſo compleat would pleaſe me much better then the great one ſo ſpoyled. In reality, I count you happier for the converſe of that venerable Old Man, then if you were in ordinary with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> then if that Father of the Gods and King of men ſhould carry you with him to his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets in the Ocean, though Nectar be poured out there in buckets, and the Muſes ſay Grace to him.

                  <p>I Maintain it openly that your Verſe has no whit advantage of your Proſe: or if you would not have me ſpeak like the People, I tell all that will hear me, you are not leſs valiant on foot, then on Horſe-back. The Panegyricke to our Monſieur <hi>d'Argenſon,</hi> and the vote for our Monſieur <hi>de Villemonte</hi> are worthy your Art, and their Vertue. I equally eſteem the materialls and the workmanſhip, the richneſs of the ſtuffe and raritie of the embrodery. In how agreeable a dreſſe you have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh'd the objects of my love! you repreſent them to me, if it be poſſible, more amiable then they ſeem'd before. It is true, there is a neighbouring Vicar, to whom I ſhewed both the Pieces, and he produc'd me the ſtory of the two Parrots that were taught to ſpeak at <hi>Rome</hi> during the War at <hi>Actium;</hi> one of which the Jugler had inſtructed to cry <hi>AVE VICTOR CAESAR,</hi> and the other <hi>AVE VICTOR ANTONI:</hi> But I ſtoutly defended the honour of your Muſes againſt his allegation: I anſwered him, that here was no War, no Enemy; and that to commend the Predeceſſour and the Succeſſour was one and the ſame thing? it is only to praiſe the Kings Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Queens choice, and their Councill's judgment. Let not therefore an aſſault that I have repelled already for you, give you any diſquiet; and enjoy peaceably the glory you have deſerv'd by labouring to celebrate that of others; I am,</p>

                  <p>I Had ſent to morrow into <hi>Poictou,</hi> if I had not this day heard you were at <hi>Paris.</hi> Your Steward amazed me with the newes, and hath taken me off the hopes I had to feaſt you here within four or five dayes. The Learned <hi>Peyrarede</hi> is to be here within that time, if he be a man of his word. He brings along with him his obſervations upon <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Martial,</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:170361:58"/> to mingle with our Melons, and our Muſhromes: with all which, and a great deal of ſalt and pepper, we ſhall make no contemptible olives. But what ſhall we do in the meane time for your incomparable way of diſcourſe; your facetious Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, your conſtant and perpetuall mirth? where will that picture of a young Pope be, in whoſe company no melancholly is able to keep countenance? his meere Idea infuſes delighting conceits into me, in the midſt of my ſadneſſe: On a day too, wherein I take Phyſick, when I do not ſo much as write to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Pomponius Atticus,</hi> you provide me this happy inſtant, to offer my ſelfe to you both in Latin and French againſt Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur the Priour and Monſieur the judge. They have either of them made a match to aſſault you in his own Language as ſoon as ever you come into the Country. But what honour do I foreſee for you! how bright a day will this be, and what new rayes it will adde to your ſplendour! I am now making ready to clappe my hands and cry out <hi>Vivat</hi> and <hi>Sophos,</hi> to the great <hi>Monſieur de la Thibaudier.</hi> If your ſteward is to be believed, you are already ſo great that you can beget nothing that is little: He hath told us miracles of that little Gallant of your own mould, that is not yet five yeares and a halfe old. Is it true, that he had rather go out at the windowes then at the doores; that he runnes upon the brink of precipices; that he goes to go to ſnatch the thing he loves, out of the middle of the fire? Theſe are the rudiments of a Heroe, whoſe Hiſtory ſhall one day be written by ſome <hi>Gomberville.</hi> I ſpeak in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; <hi>Aeneas</hi> did not do more for his father, then your ſonne ha's already done for roaſted apples.

                  <p>I Received your Letter as if it had dropped down from Heaven, and brought me back my good fortune. I ſpeak thus, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard I thought you were not willing I ſhould be happy any longer, and becauſe I grow diſtruſtfull of all the good things of this world. The obſtinacy of your ſilence made me feare ſomething worſe then the diſcontinuation of our correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. When I had a mind to flatter my ſelfe, I fancied you had forgot me without hating me, and that your friendſhip had expired of a naturall death. I have cry'd aloud but my voice was not heard: I writ Letters and had no anſwer. For it is moſt true; I could retort all the complaints you urge upon me. I could call you cruell, or at leaſt diſdainefull, but that I had rather find out ſome extrinſecall cauſe of this default and lay the blame upon the Poſts, or the Seaſons; Fortune, and Deſtiny, and any thing elſe, then you. At laſt I underſtood, there was a packet for me at <hi>Paris,</hi> and the vertuous Madam — ſent me the happy tidings of it. But, would you believe, Sir, that this packet ha's grown old at the Poſte-houſe, and that after its arrivall at <hi>Paris,</hi> I was conſtrain'd to expect its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither above four months? Certainly there muſt be ſome <hi>Damon</hi> envious of my happineſſe whoſe only employment is to put barricadoes between you and me, and way-layes all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents that come to me out of <hi>Holland.</hi> Sometimes he intercepts your Letters; ſometimes he is contented to retard them, and not being able to make me loſe your affection, he croſſes me all he is able, in the enjoyment of your favours. Nevertheleſſe, in deſpight of this evill Spirit and all his malice, your preſents are here put into the port, after a voyage of ſix months; and with your elegant Letter, I have received the platforme of your faire Houſe. To judge of the excellency of ſuch a compleat piece, requires more skilfull eyes then mine and ſuch as are better purged of earthly vapours, and the Barbariſm of the Country. A man muſt be of <hi>Rome</hi> to do it, and not of this village, where nature indeed, hath ſome graces and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but art is violated on all ſides, and hath received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite outrages by Artificers. Inſtead of your Ideas of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and your Maſter-pieces of Wit and Hand, you can ſee
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170361:64"/> nothing here but confuſed rubbidge; but Monſters and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of ſtone that will trouble you to behold them. There is not one part in its right place, not one place but hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity in Architecture, and offends the Eyes of ſuch as look upon it knowingly. So that if you would do me the ſame hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our you deſire I ſhould receive at your houſe, I ſhould be forced (out of feare of bringing you into a Chaos of diſorder and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity) to pitch a Tent on the bank of my River, having firſt found o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes I attend ſixe months for one good hour: and all my Learned neighbours have had opportunity to read your excellent Manuſcripts before my turne came to receive that contentment. At length I have ſurveyed your agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able work.

You perceive by this I am none of thoſe who think the bride too handſome, or accuſe the Gaſcons for being too valiant; in this kind, I like too much better then too little. I know magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence borders neerer upon prodigality then its other extream of thrift; and magnanimity has more affinity with raſh hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then with fear: therefore if you exceed the ordinary bounds whether in the adornments of your ſtyle, or height of your fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, my Civility muſt ever conclude, in favour of your Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, that the Prodigall is better then Niggard, and exceſſe more commendable then defect.

                  <p>I Am not a ſubject worthy to be preached by you, and yet what do you not ſay of me in the two Letters you did me the honour to write? I perceive by them you cannot flye but high, and that you abuſe good Language, when you do not imploy it lawfully. Reduce it I beſeech you, to its primitive and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate uſe. Lay out your Rhetorick only towards our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and returne to delight us by inſtructing us. Since my Morality and Politicks have neither made me a better nor happier man. I expect that from the Goſpell and from you, which <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> could not give me. As there is <hi>an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of Errour</hi> of which the <hi>Apostle ſpeeks,</hi> ſo there is a <hi>power of truth</hi> that animates the Spirits of Apoſtolicall men; and makes it ſelf viſible in their diſcourſes. This ſacred violence is not wanting in you, and I am deceived or I have more then once ſeen it iſſue out of your mouth vvith Thunder and Lightning to work upon the ſouls of your Auditours. Mine may be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without reſiſtance: She will gaine by ſuffering her ſelfe to be conquered. But beſides my intereſt, civility obliges me to it: I muſt needs owe you the reformation of my Life, that our friendſhip may not be diſhonourable to your vertue, and that I may not be leſſe one of your creatures in our Lord, then I am,</p>

He does imitate in ſuch a manner that he himſelfe is even an Originall. He is one of the Children, not one of the Apes of Antiquity; and had I ſeen nothing of his but his Articles of Treaty with the Muſes, I ſhould have concluded, he muſt neceſſarily be no leſſe a gallant man then a great Scholler; no leſſe of the Court of <hi>Augustus,</hi> then of the Age of <hi>Virgil.</hi> I find this Capitulation ſo pleaſant, that I am vext it was not mine.

                  <p>IF not to be thankfull enough be ingratitude, I have reaſon to complaine of your generoſity; which drives me into that involuntary crime, by reducing me to an invincible diſability. This is the third time your exceſſes make me apprehenſive, and ſenſible of my poverty. When you do me favours, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of the meanes, to thank you for them; and the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage you uſe is ſo lively, ſo ſprightly, and full of fire, that I find mine, no more but ice in compariſon of it. You leave me nothing to ſay, ſo that I muſt for my own honour entrench my

But what is it My Lord I would not do, for your ſervice; and your glory? could you ſee the bottome of my ſoul, what deſires, what reſentments would you not behold there? Never had any ſoul more paſſionate deſires, or an higher adoration; for though Wealth ſhould ſhower upon your houſe, and Crownes upon your head; (this ſhower of Crownes is one of Cardinall <hi>Perron's</hi> wiſhes), though Fortune ſhould every day bribe you; and fame doe nothing elſe but commend you, I ſay (though but a part of what I think) that they would do but juſtice to your vertue.

There is ſo much ſweetneſſe in the remembrance of our good Cardinall, that I may ſay; he takes reſts upon this ſubject, that is tyred with any other.

It is no ſmall content to me to underſtand, your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne had ſomewhat of triumph in it, and that you manage the affaires of your Charge amidſt the acclamations of your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The paſſion I have for you, gives me an intereſt of all theſe happy ſucceſſes and making me look upon them at firſt as my own, and yours in the ſecond place. I could have wiſht my ſelf a witneſs of them, and have come to reverence you in a Chaire, which you render more illuſtrious then Thrones publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing from thence the myſteries of the Son of God, which are far better &amp; more ſaving than Arreſts and Edicts. But I am not fortunate enough for this; and I aſſure my ſelf, you will be ſo mercifull in the purſuance of your Rights, and indulgent to my weakneſs, that you will diſpenſe with a vow for me which I am not able to performe.

It was in earneſt, a very dyſaſtrous happe to have a treaſure ſo long in ones cuſtody, and not dare touch it; to have the poſſeſſion of one of the fineſt things in the world without the poſſible power of enjoyment. This fine thing, Sir, is the Genealogie you were pleaſed to communicate to me; and if I tell you, the multitude of thoſe illuſtrious names dazelled me, and that confluence of ſtarrs which makes the milky way in heaven, does not caſt ſuch a ſplendour, nor encloſe ſo many Demy-gods, I ſhall poſſibly ſpeak like a Poet, yet offer no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the purity of truth.

I made it formerly on an occaſion that obliged me to it; and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne in it was rather to condemn Avarice then plead for Vanity. But Sir, I muſt now let you ſee, that Secular Authours are not alwayes profane ones, and we ſometimes confine upon matters of piety. Here is ſomething concerning Apoſtolicall and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Rome,</hi> that you may not think I am inſeperably addicted to conſular and triumphing <hi>Rome.</hi> The work is Chriſtian, and compoſed in the Language of the Church; and Monſieur the Cardinall <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> hath approved it —. Yet I beſeech you expect nothing regular or dogmaticall in it. I have not argued in mode and figure: nor ſliced out my matter into Sections and Paragraphs. I have choſen the ſtyle of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Prophets, rather then that of the moderne Doctours; and though I am not ſo good a Divine as <hi>Becanus,</hi> I would very faine be as good as <hi>Orpheus,</hi> if it be too much to ſay, as <hi>David.</hi> I ſhall know your opinion of my <hi>Divinity,</hi> and my verſes, when I have the honour to ſee you. This cannot be ſo ſoon as I wiſh it, for I am impatient to be with you, and proteſt to you by word of mouth, that none is more truly then my ſelfe,</p>

                  <p>HEre lately paſſed a Nymph this way, whoſe elegancy and promptneſſe of tongue is admirable. She informed me of an infinite number of things that I was ignorant of before. And though ſhe has not ſo many mouths, as that other lying Nymph who preſides over Panegyrickes and funerall Orations; yet ſhe hath one extreamly eloquent, which does not marre good ſubjects, as it embelliſhes only ſuch as are true; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I exerciſe your patience, and you expect the name of this Nymph. Not to make you Languiſh any longer; She is called in the Language of men, Madamoiſelle <hi>de Newfoic.</hi> But it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes you to know, ſhe is your votary, though her ſelfe adored by me and others. You may pleaſe to know, that ſhe ſings you in what place ſoever ſhe can find Auditours or Ecchoes. She hath ſtrewed our Hillocks, our Plaines, and Valleyes with your praiſes —. Among other things, ſhe affirmes, you better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the duties of Amity then the illuſtrious friends mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Lucians Toxaris.</hi> She is, in a word, a very magnificent and generous publiſher of all your merits. But, to tel you the truth, this laſt hath made moſt impreſſion on me, and is the reaſon why I write this Letter to you, with as little ceremony as if, theſe ſix yeares ſilence, I had written to you by every poſte. Nor is this all, I intend ſomething more then a Letter, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a Suite and a ſolicitour to you: I entreat your credit and care for him to obtain what he deſires, and beſeech you to oblige me effectually in his perſon, with your intereſt in our common Lord —.

I wiſh I could be as ſerviceable to him as he was acceptable to me. But I have no power in the world, and can only make vowes in the deſart. Yet I am ſure of one thing; never man, my Lord, knew better then I, how to owne the courteſies done to my friends. This gentleman hath no great reaſon to be contented with his fortune; and for my part, ſince I am able only to wiſh him a better, if you judge him worthy of any of your favours, I ſhall willingly beare a part in the obligation, and not be leſſe, then if I received them my ſelfe,</p>

Since I am ſo throughly conſcious of your power, I cannot in the leaſt doubt the truth of the miracle, and I know long agoe by experience that you are able to accompliſh things beyond the ordinary reach. I

                  <p>MY two years ſilence hath been the effect of ſeverall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky cauſes: melancholy and grief have done their parts and there ha's been a little concurrence of debauchery with a great deal of lazineſſe and ſome buſineſſe. Any perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides you, would think ſtrange that I put buſineſs into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of evills, but ſince you flye from it to the further end of the world, and the leaſure of the deſart ſeems more agreeable to you then the moſt eminent employments at Court I may not fear to diſcloſe my inclination to you which your example ha's juſtified. You have obliged me, Sir, by the care you have taken to let me underſtand the truth of that which I knew only by hear-ſay. Let <hi>Rouliers</hi> Sonne be of as mean extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as he can, he is an illuſtrious Raſcal, and I look upon him as the <hi>Ventidius</hi> of our age. That <hi>Ventidius</hi> that beat the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> in ſeverall battells, and revenged the affronts the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans had received, climb'd up from ſlavery to command, by

                  <p>EVery thing that comes out of your hands, every thing that bears your name, is precious. Your remembrance is very obliging in all manners. In a little note, written to another in the ſimplicity of a ſudden thought, raiſed only by chance, it had been exceeding deare to me. I leave you to imagine with what joy I received it, being embelliſhed, with infinite riches and ornaments, and accompanied with an eloquent Preface, which I found followed by an excellent Poem. If this Poem be the laſt preſent you intend to the Theater, as you put us in fear; you cannot take your leave of the people, with an Adieu more remarkeable then that, or that will make your departure more regretted. I ſubcribe in generall to what is ſaid of it in the Preface, and further adde this, Sir; That <hi>Arminius</hi> is not only your Maſter-piece, but the Maſter-piece of the Art; that he will bring honour to our Muſes, and put a jealouſie into thoſe of our neighbours. I proceed ſtill, that it is a child which ſpeakes the place of his extraction, and the courage of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Meere imitation and the borrowed greatneſſe of matter, fly not ſo high: There is ſomething here naturall and your own; and it was not enough to be a learned and ingenious perſon but Magnanimity and Gallantry were required to make <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> ſpeak ſo nobly.

I could not have preſumed more then to have made a part of the people, on the feaſtivalls of <hi>France,</hi> and joyned my voyce to the publick acclamations, which at this day are the muſick of the Hoſtel of <hi>Conde,</hi> and ſo agreeably diſturb the quiet of the moſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all mothers. This Title belongs to your Highneſſe;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170361:80"/> who by the birth of one Prince have oblig'd the whole World. 'Tis to your happy fruitfulneſs that our Age owes all its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament honour and luſtre: and you the perſon that have aſtoniſh'd all Nations with the late miracles they have ſeen. If the Kings Soveraignty ha's grown beyond the extent of his own Kingdome; If his Kingdome have no frontiers after ſo many conqueſts and triumphs, theſe are in truth, the atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Princes hands who ha's not reckoned above two and twenty years in the world. But they proceed, Madam, from that flowre and perfection of the bloud of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> which is deriv'd from you. Is there any of the French nation who is not an Enemy to his Country, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines his vowes for the perpetuity of your contentment? And ought we not to wiſh your Highneſs, a long and peaceable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a good in which we are rich as well as you? For my part, I beſeech Heaven, Madam, that he may never be raviſh'd from you; not even by the violent paſſion of ſome forraign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enamour'd with his heroicke vertue, or by the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of ſome elective Crowne, who may once more come to deſire a King from <hi>France.</hi> Theſe misfortunes, Madam, are thoſe that attend of a too great felicity. They threaten the heads of few Princes, and all Princeſſes are not in a condition to fear them. But I may confidently preſage that never more any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity or dyſaſter ſhall betide your Family, if my prayers be ſucceſsfull, and I be as propitiouſly heard by Heaven as I am paſſionately,</p>

                  <p>THE Letter which your Highneſs ha's honour'd me with writing, hath calmed the diſquiet of my mind. I perceive manifeſtly, My LORD, that I was but alarm'd, and ſome were pleaſed to make an experiment of my paſſion. But the ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I have conceived againſt the World made me not unapt to believe ill newes. Since I know there is no Saint in Heaven but ha's been traduc'd on Earth, I did not imagine that the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170361:80"/> fate of naked and common innocente could ſcape better then that of triumphant and ſoveraigne vertue. Yet this world is not ſo univerſally corrupted, but that there is ſome found part of it: There is ſome place of ſafety from the perſecution of the wicked, and honeſt men find ſanctuary in your Lordſhips pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. All your inclinations tend to Greatneſſe, not any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects to Tyranny, ſo that he that is not preſerved in your Highneſſes love muſt needs have a deſigne to loſe himſelfe there. God keep me, my Lord, from ſo dangerous a thought. Since Calumny can prevaile nothing in your Court, I cannot feare any injury in this Country; and my conſcience beares me witneſſe of the paſſion wherewith I have ever been, and deſire to be eternally,</p>

                  <p>I Do not ſtay for your favours to teſtifie my gratitude. The only intention you had to favour me hath already extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged me. Though it ſhould ſtill remaine in your thoughts without producing its effect, yet it would at leaſt be a very faire Idea; it would draw a man out of oblivion of whom the world hath no longer Remembrance: it would do me no injury in repreſenting me in the chiefe diſpencer of juſtice, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more deſerving then I am. It would be, My Lord, an interiour action of Liberty and Choice, which not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to any ſecond ſubject, would terminate in it ſelfe, and without appearance, retaine its merit in its own reality. The vulgar call nothing benefits but what they handle, and falls under their ſenſe. They meaſure them only by ſucceſſe, which is within the juriſdiction of Fortune. Speculative men aſcend higher: They meet courteſies in the Rudiments of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as pure acts and ſeperate from matter: and deferre not their gratitude untill the event, which would in that caſe be involv'd in chance and hazard. That which is not now, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may never be, and the moſt faithfull promiſes are expoſed to all the uncertainty of the future and the changes of humane things; yet they ceaſe not to be eſteemed faithfull. Thus My Lord, I have received from you the favour which may properly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170361:81"/> be called yours, though I am yet in expectance of the benefit of it, from the king. And I maintaine againſt all thoſe who are not of my opinion; that you have given it me in your promiſe. It may poſſibly fall out that I ſhall receive nothing of it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ill fortune that attends me: but it is beyond the reach of Fate to deſtroy the obligation, I have to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, according to the maximes I have learnt. Your good-will having ſatisfied my ambition, my neceſſity doth not preſſe me ſo hard; as to I account it in the firſt place. Eſteem is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more noble then payment, and the <hi>Honeſt</hi> ſhall ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me for the loſſe of the <hi>Profitable.</hi> But in the meane time, that I may not ſeeme to deliberate upon the reality of my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to you, after the aſſurances I received in the Letters of Monſieur <hi>de Bois-Robert.</hi> I will not deferre till to morrow the proteſtation which I make, to be perfectly,</p>

                  <p>YOur favours juſtifie my ſolitude, and the benefit I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon your recommendation makes me eminent in the world, though I am no longer of it. It declares to ſuch as throng and runne, that there is an idleneſſe which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth rewards, and a reſt that you eſteem. All the hands that ſerve the State, are not employed in killing men, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving Engines: ſome there are which are lifted up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſecond thoſe that fight, and pray to God for the victory: Some of them make diſpatches and Commiſſions: Some draw Redoubts and Battaglias; and ſcore out on paper, what is to be executed in the field: and ſome without noiſe labour for the glory of their Prince, and the edification of his ſubjects. I wil not ſay, My Lord, that mine have been ſo nobly employed, nor pretend to that glory which was beſtowed on <hi>Phidias;</hi> of having made the image of a God which added much devotion to what was payed him before: I only ſay, that if to be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man and a good Citizen is the firſt part of the definition of a good Oratour, the halfe of that excellent quality cannot in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170361:81"/> reaſon be diſputed with me; that in the greateſt ſeverity the ſuperaboundance of paſſion deſerves pardon for the defects of Art. But I am well aſſured of the extent of your indulgence, and there is not ſo ſlender a mediocrity in the profeſſion of good Letters; but you take delight to exalt it by your Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. You love honeſt converſations becauſe you have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their moſt ſecret, and peculiar beauties: and carefully oppoſe the return of ignorance, becauſe you very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that if the French ſhould relapſe to Barbariſm, your vertue would be but coorſely commended by Barbarian Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and Poets. So that your protection upon the intereſt of your vertue will cheriſh and encourage the <hi>Literati</hi> of our age; yea even poliſh and civilize our rudneſs and villages. It will cauſe a lovely ſpring of new Excellencies on every ſide, and make all France learned. They are your benefits, my Lord, which ſhall reſtore to honour ſuch degraded perſons as were once termed holy, though in theſe dayes are accounted unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable pieces of the State. But notwithſtanding your Lordſhip ha's oblig'd me with a new favour, advantage and gettings are not the principall importances that have rendred me your ſuppliant. A few things content a ſoul, that hath been initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſtudy of Wiſdom; and being not in diſtreſs for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryes, I can deſire nothing of anothers, but ſuch as I can well be without, and which in the ſtrictneſs of Philoſophy is eſteem'd ſuperfluous. I ſpeak of Fortunes favours and bounties; for, as to your Lordſhips affection, and eſteem, they are happineſses which I do not ranke in this Catalogue. They are eſſential parts of that bliſs I ſeek in this world. I have abſolute need of them for the content of my life; and it is certain I ſhould not be my own friend if I were not your Lordſhip's favourit; being with all my ſoul,</p>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170361:82"/> any returnes of my ſervices, but favours received and many ancient courreſies, as arguments to obtaine a new. I would willingly, My Lord, compile the hiſtory of your good deeds, to put you in remembrance of the place whither they were accuſtomed to flow, and of the pleaſure you took to ſend <hi>Manna</hi> to the deſart. But particular ſtories muſt not be drawn into example, nor the gifts of Heaven abuſed.

Himſelf will declare to you the merits of his cauſe, if you pleaſe to do him the honour of your attention. If his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts may receive any advantage from my teſtimony, I can aſſure you that he is an Officer who hath grown old in his Command with a reputation of Underſtanding and Honeſty, and this no more then might be confirmed by the publique voice of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.

It is true, the preſent was but trivial: I am aſhamed to put you in mind now, that great hearts are ſo neceſſary in great enterprizes, and unleſs you reckon a great deal of paſſion and zeal for ſomething, I ſhould not in time of War have mention'd a toy of ſo little uſe as that. Yet my Lord, is there no place for a violent paſſion, in your ſervice? Cannot a zealous ſpirit produce ſome thoughts couragious enough to venter beyond the proſpect of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age, and more Noble then to injure the glory of your great Name?

Could you exceed Cardinal <hi>Baronio</hi> in the ſolidity of your learning, yet it is better to follow Cardinal <hi>Borromeo,</hi> in the Sanctity of your Life, and be the ſubject of others writings, then the Hiſtorian of their actions. How happy do I eſteem the meaneſt labourers that you uſe in your great work! and I cannot expreſs how it troubles me to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſirous of being with you, and yet to ſtick faſt here, and to be able to profeſs to you only with wiſhes and idle paſſions, I know not when, that I am more then any perſon in the World,</p>

                  <p>I Perceive there is no poſſibility, for me to execute my grand enterprize, or to effect what I have had in deſigne theſe ten yeares. My journey to <hi>Languedoc,</hi> is likely to become the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170361:84"/> of a man that ſtirs not, or the dreame of one awake. If Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will have it ſo, I ſhall at leaſt have this happineſs, nothing can hinder me the enjoying in my mind, the contentment which I fancy. My imagination, that hath power to bring me neer to places where I deſire to be, walks me continually round about this diſtant happineſs, and puts me into poſſeſſion of one of the apartments of your Palace, and ſoon after lodges me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in your Library. O how I contemne the Jaſper and guildings of the Eſcuriall, when I am in that Cabinet? This indeed is to inhabite a more Noble and ſtately Court, to be the gueſt of an infinite number of rare ſouls, and bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences; where after a repaſt of Tanzies and Mellons, the entertainment might be with light and truth. I do not ſeek out high words to abuſe them, I employ them in their proper and naturall ſignification: for what is there, My Lord, which the deſire of knowledge and ambition of learning can imagine exquiſite and rare, but is to be found either in your books, or converſation? thoſe three or four hours I had the honour to paſs with you, preſented to me the riches of ages, and antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! you taught me things which not only the commonalty of the learned are ignorant of, but ſuch as, it may be, the Princes of the Schools underſtand not. The ſeverall manuſcripts your goodneſs daign'd to ſhew me, left ſo faire an impreſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity upon my ſoul, that immediately I divorced my ſelf from my old Loves, and bad adieu to all the muſes that are not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Since that time I ſpeak nothing but of the Primitive Church and the Oecumenicall Councells: and you have ſo alienated me from Pagan-Rome, that in thoſe places of Hiſtory where I meet with <hi>Aquilae,</hi> I am ſometimes ready to change it into <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barum.</hi> A communication of ſuch advantage deſerves to be ſought, though it were at the end of the World; and a thouſand leagues are nothing to be travelled for it. To confeſs freely: the voyages of the Graecian Philoſophers into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> do very much reproach my immobilitie. It is neceſſary that I rouze up this Lethargy, or to ſpeak more humanely, that I prop up this weakneſs and provide redreſs to this infirmity: and ſince it is impoſſible it ſhould endure a Coach, unleſs in a Downe or a Meadow, I am at this inſtant going to purchaſe a Litter, to make it more capable of the journey, and tranſport me without diſturbance, to the feet of a greater Maſter then <hi>Gamaliel.</hi> The ambition of a ſpirit cured of the Court, may well be terminated there, where I ſhall receive your anſwers to my Queſtions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

This reſt, Sir, which the people calls the whole, is but the groſs materiall part of the obligation; and this fortune who takes delight in ſporting with events, and deſtroying hopes, cannot reach the principle of well doing which reſides in the mind. You have therefore been beneficent in deſpight of her, and I will be gratefull in the ſame manner: For, whatever misfortune ſhe ha's blown upon the Kings gift ſo that it could not paſs the Seal, yet ſhe could not hinder me from finding a great treaſure in the loſs of a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of 3 thouſand livres: I mean Sir, the aſſurance you have in your actions, with which I dare not call my ſelf unhappy, and am at leaſt ſatisfied with the negotiation of my friend.

I conſider this honour, as a Favour from Heaven, arriv'd to a man that never ſayes his prayers. He offers up neither vowes nor ſacrifices, and yet his indevotion failes not to be happy; and receives the rewards of Piety. You are ſtored with theſe goodneſſes of Heaven, amidſt the wickedneſſes of the Earth; and you ſeek after thoſe ſavadges, Madam, that endevour to avoid you —. Yet it is not requiſite for me to take this paines to bring my ſelf into a bad reputation, or decry my ſelf with ſo much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care. Queſtionleſſe, Madam, you more regard the inſide of things then the ſurface and outward appearance. You have the gift to behold the actings of immateriall ſouls, and ſo conſequently you perceive there, that the private mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my heart cleare me of all the ill conjectures that might condemne me. That is a place I alwayes reſerve for you, though I never give you an account of it: Al there is ful of zeal, and reverence to your vertue, and if externall acts were not of the eſſence of true worſhip, I would challenge the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent of your Courtiers, for the glory of being more yours, then he conceives himſelf to be. This being granted, Madam, I beſeech you, not to conceive it poſſible for me to deliberate on any propoſition that regards your ſervice or contentment: or that I need quickning and excitation to indeavour the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing my intereſts into your affections. I could wiſh they were leſſe juſt then they are, that my obedience might be purer, then it will be, and that you might ſee I can perform your will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining your commands. The Gentleman that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me your Letter, will confirme what I ſay, and make his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the things he hath ſeen already. I had begun them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

The end ſhall ſoon follow the beginning: and if you do me the honour to caſt your eye upon my paines, I aſſure my ſelfe you will accept my devotion.

                  <p>IS it poſſible that I am the perſon of whom you have ſung ſuch excellent things? it is almoſt beyond my beliefe, and though my friend aſſures me of it, and I read my name in your verſes, I am in doubt whether there be not another <hi>Balzac,</hi> more worthy of that Honour. Perhaps I am not the true one, and I owe my good fortune to an Equivocall name. Yet I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I have heard it reported for one of <hi>Jupiters</hi> paſtimes, to enrich poverty, and exalt meaneneſſe. In which regard I am not longer in wonder, that the Muſes ſhould be of their Fathers humour, and that they love the ſame divertiſement with him. You have therefore with your pen ennobled a viſion which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to you for my advantage; you have lifted me from Earth to Heaven: you have celebrated the Apotheôſis of a man yet alive: of a man that hath no Legions, who is not clad in purple, nor hath founded you a Colledge: yet you have brought more pompe and more ornaments to this unintereſſed Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, then is to be found in that which is left us by Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and <hi>Herodian</hi> hath ſo magnificently deſcribed. It is too ſuperlative an exceſſe, Reverend father, and though I had the vertue of moderation and equanimity yet my happineſſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, and irregular; ſo that I juſtly apprehend the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of that Goddeſſe, whom the Language of your verſe calls <hi>The terrible Nemeſis,</hi> ſhe puniſhes the proſperous as well as the proud, and does not willingly let feſtivalls paſs without troubling their ſerenity with ſome dyſaſter But is it not poſſible to get her, in lieu of her intereſt, and for the tempering of my great fortune, to be ſatisfied with a douzen fits of a feaver, and five and thirty ounces of blood, which are already drawn from

If I could eſcape on theſe termes I ſhould take my diſeaſe for a remedy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I had made a good purchaſe of your praiſes. Is it a good that can be bought too dearely, to be commended by father <hi>Theron?</hi> Should it not be the ambition of Kings, and the deſire of them that poſſeſſe all things? The fabrick of Glory that is raiſ'd by their hands, hath nothing of fraile or mortall. That which you have beſtowed on me, ſhall not periſh with my name, which yet may be contagious. It will preſerve both it ſelfe and that too, by your excellent induſtry. Poſterity ſhall receive it as pure and undecayed, as I did out of your packet; and Marble ſhall be duſt, when your works ſhall be yet entire —. For a Future ſo glorious, for ſo many Ages of faire Reputation, and for the Eternity you have made me ſure of, it is very reaſonable that I be perfectly all my life,</p>

                  <p>THough I am ordinarily but little ſatisfi'd with my ſelfe, yet I dare not queſtion the merit of a piece which your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation ha's made good. Your praiſes give a ſecond luſtre to my writings which will laſt longer then that of the impreſſion, and makes me eſteem them more beautious and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then they were. It is very difficult to containe within the limits of modeſty after ſo favourable a ſentence from ſo authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick place. I am reſolved, at leaſt not to be ſo compliant with thoſe which do not treat me equitably. So that though I aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my own intereſts, I am oblig'd to maintaine your opinions, and defend my ſelfe for your ſake. Whoever, then, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict you, let him not think to perſwade me; I except neither the Courtiers, nor Schollers. If the Court it ſelf fancy ſome taint in my French of the Provinces on this ſide <hi>Loire;</hi> or the Univerſity diſrelliſh my Latin, ſince you have declared for both, I will ſay the Court is troubled with Rheume, and the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie's palate is out of taſte. I acknowledge you, Sir, a Legall judge of both the times: I meane venerable Antiquity, and our fine Barbarisme; of the Language of the Soveraigne and victorious people, and of the change introduced in the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170361:86"/> of the Empire, by the conquer'd nations. You have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from good books the ſplendour and Majeſty of the dead Tongue, and from good uſe the politeneſſe and excellency of the living. You are rich both by birth and acquiſition, and have Title to keep the ſame rank in old <hi>Rome</hi> that you hold among the Eloquent of <hi>Paris.</hi> What an advantage is it to be able to ſay, <hi>I have that perſon on my ſide!</hi> There is no pretender but would paſſe upon ſo conſiderable an atteſtation; no Litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, but dreads ſo intelligent a juſtice; nor any enemy, that dares aſſail a place which you defend. One would think it ſufficient that you did defend it, but you embelliſh it with ſo much care of ornament, that I who made it, can ſcarce know it, Whatſoever you are pleaſ'd to ſay, they are your flowers and not mine that make the avenues ſo pleaſant: and that your Letter at the beginning of my book, would look no further for the Spring or Chaplets which you promiſe. I keep this Letter as one of the moſt precious <hi>jewells</hi> in my treaſury: and will produce it in time and place againſt the oppoſitions of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians and Sophiſters. I am not the child of ſo perverſe a Mother; but ſhe will give me the liberty to do it, and allow me to eſteem a ſtranger, whom ſhe would be very glad to adopt, and make her own.

In the greateſt heat of the warre kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, you ſheltred my innocence: You were ſtronger then Calumny; and if the Senatours and Cardinalls are now partiſans for me, it is becauſe you were my Protectour at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> you did after the ſame manner endeare me in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in Courts the moſt diſtant from our world. Your judgment hath regulated that of Potentates: and the Letters I receive, dated from the ſhoares of the <hi>Baltick</hi> ſea, are effects
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170361:87"/> of the curioſity you have infuſed into the nations of the North, of knowing a perſon which you love. But ſhall I conceale the braveſt part of my Adventures? Is it not to you I owe that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious ſentence that the king of <hi>Denmark</hi> pronounced in my favour? and did he not take you for his aſſiſtant, nay for his whole Councell, when the Lutheran Biſhop that conteſted with me loſt his cauſe in an Audience compoſ'd of Princes and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes? Since you remembred me at <hi>Capenhagen,</hi> there was no feare you ſhould forget me at <hi>Paris;</hi> and that which I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the new obligations I have to you did ſo little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize me, that though I am ſenſibly affected with them, yet there being no novelty to amaze me, I could not teſtifie any great extaſie or emotion. I apprehended much joy at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of your goodneſſe but this joy hath not excited any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary agitation in my heart: it did not diſcover it ſelfe outwardly by the diſcompoſing of my countenance: nor tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me to undecent exclamation. My acknowledgement was ever pure and without diſturbance, and be pleaſ'd to excuſe at preſent the nakedneſſe and ſimplicity of its addreſſe.

If a perſon whom you have gain'd, whom you have preſerved, and conferred honour on, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured favours to, ſhould not call himſelfe yours, I do not know with all my Grammars and Dictionaries, what name to find out for ſuch a man. But there are yet ſome further concernments, and I have received advantages of another nature. Were I not the ſubject you have painted and beautified, yet you are Maſter of that Art that furniſhes us with colours, and ornaments: I have nothing for my part but what you have diſtributed to me; and how often have I proteſted in full and glorious Academy that I had leſſe profited by <hi>Quintilian's</hi> precepts then by your examples; and that I had more enriched my ſelfe with what I had received from your mouth, then what I had romaged from the Treaſuries of Antiquity. It is that eloquent mouth that hath oftentimes been more ſerviceable to a good cauſe, then both the wings of an army: It is by that, the King ſpeaks ſo high, and ſo effectually to forrainers, that he makes himſelfe ſo many friends and ſervants; I meane Soveraigne and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſervants. If it were lawfull for me, I would ſay, you have gain'd me with the ſame power, and you poſſeſſe me by the ſame
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170361:87"/> title, that I am one of your firſt conquered, and your firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that I yielded my ſelf upon your approach, and that I met my felicity in my ſurrender.

                  <p>YOu make complaints againſt your old age, and I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to write the Elogium of it. I will extoll it publiquely
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170361:88"/> and <hi>in genere Demonstrativo;</hi> that age which is priviledged and cheriſhed by Heaven, free and exempted from all the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive tribute, that other men pay nature, and purpoſes as an example by our goddeſſes, to excite ambition and courage in our young men. The winters of <hi>Naples,</hi> me thinks, have ſome reſemblance with it, thoſe cleare and ſerene Winters that are gilded with light, and crowned with roſes; that of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiniſſa</hi> was leſſe green and vigourous, and the child which he begot at fourſcore was a production not comparable to your Poem at threeſcore and fifteen. The reaſon is, that the fire which deſcends from Heaven by way of inſpiration, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the diminution of naturall heat: and if Art have found out the invention of unextinguiſhable lampes, the Maſter of Art may very well preſerve in its full force the igneous part of our mind, and make the ardour and vivacity of its operations du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Are there not ſome ſenſible repreſentations of this happy duration? who knowes not that gold is refined by waxing old, and that the Sunne its father, is as bright in one thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty two, as he was the very day of his creation? I muſt therefore diſclaime that erroneous ſentence which I have formerly ſo much cryed up as a propoſition of eternall truth, <hi>That there was never ſeen a handſome old woman.</hi> Pardon me that raſh expreſſion, I was not then acquainted with your Muſe, which gives my propoſition the lye, and decryes a Proverbe, to which I thought to have given eternity. Her age do's not cauſe the declining of her beauty, but is the confirmation of it by the very ſuffrage of Time, by approbation of the Preſent, as well as the Paſt: it is not a mark of the victory of yeares over her, but a trophy of her reſiſtance and ſtrength againſt time. I ſpeak as I am really perſwaded; but were I as couragious as the Authours of your Country, I ſhould expreſſe much more: I ſhould ſay at leaſt of this admirable old Lady, that at the age of <hi>Hecuba</hi> ſhe had as many Lovers, as <hi>Helena</hi> in the flower of her youth. I could alledge an infinite numbers as well of thoſe that burn at <hi>Paris,</hi> as that ſigh on this ſide the <hi>Loire:</hi> But it ſuffices me to ſpeak for my ſelfe, who am the moſt paſſionate of them all, and as much as any perſon in the world,</p>

                  <p>THe obligations I have to you, affect me in ſuch a ſenſible manner, that I am much unſatisfied with my ſelfe, that I am able only to teſtifie to you vulgar reſentments and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments for them. Perhaps it were a ſafer crime to preſent you with none at all. The ſilence of meditation is ſomewhat more devout then the Muſick of Hymnes and Songs. There is no Sermon ſo eloquent as an Extaſie, and ſtudy may have flattery and diſſembling, when the diſtraction of the ſoul diſcovers the bottome and ſecrets. 'Tis with confuſion of my thought, My Lord, and a diſcompoſed ſpirit, that I thank you for your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. It was with tranſport, and the loſſe of ſpeech, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them lately: and I ſhould yet continue in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; were I not afraid to breed ill example among thoſe that receive favours. My traunce muſt not ever continue ſo drowzy as to hinder me from turning my eyes ſometimes towards that ſide from whence my good fortune ſhines. If I be dumbe with admiration, I will at leaſt make ſignes, that I am not ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full on purpoſe: and when I ſhall taſte thoſe pleaſant dayes at <hi>Plaſſac</hi> which you invite me to ſeek, I will ſay, at leaſt in my heart, that you and the Sunne beſtow them on me, or make uſe of a verſe in <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                     <q>It is a God that do's indulge this leiſure.</q>

                  <p>The gods, my Lord, (I ſpeak in the Language of <hi>Virgil</hi>) can not make a richer preſent to mankind: nay, they have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a better for themſelves: for it was affirm'd by one <hi>that leiſure was their buſineſſe,</hi> and by another that it was <hi>their proper poſſeſſion.</hi> I hid my ſelfe in the village for the better purſuance of this buſineſſe of Heaven, and to enjoy a happy idleneſſe: to ſatiety but my fruition hath been diſturbed, and I could not eſcape diſcovery. Though this little corner of the world be unknown both to the ancient and moderne <hi>Geography,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> ſpeakes no more of it then <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> my ill fate ha's pleaſ'd to bring it into reputation ſince my comming to it; and it is now depriv'd of that ſweet and peaceable obſcurity, wherein things unknown do reſt. All the Proſe and Verſe in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome have learnt the way thither: Paraphraſes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Orations and Panegyricks, flock to it from all parts:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170361:89"/> but eſpecially Letters, which claime a right to be admitted from the fartheſt Countries of the earth, and do verily believe they come to their own home, becauſe I have written volumes of them. They do me much honour; I confeſs it: This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution is too glorious for me: But yet it is ſtill a perſecution to a ſpirit over-charged, and that is no longer able —. I fret and repine here in vaine againſt this glory: there is no way to acquit me from it but by eſcaping into ſome place of freedome; where there is not only a porter to tell them, I am not within, but a Captain to ſpeak it with authority, and repell curioſity from ſearching after me. You do me the favour, my Lord, to offer me this place of refuge, wherein I may hope to be in ſecurity: and I know well enough that without need either of Captain or Souldiers, you have no houſe but your Name alone fortifies. It is the ſafeguard of other mens, and War reſpects it, even upon the door of a cottage. How can I fear my quiet then, when ſo powerfull an authority aſſures it to me, and your goodneſs vouchſafes to own me, of whom I am and will ever be paſſionately all my life,</p>

There needs not more for this, but common ſenſe, and ſelf-love, and as in ſome mens judgment, I have ſome of this love to ſpare, ſo in my own opinion, I do not altogether fail in the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall part.

I ſhall be very glad to pleaſe you, in my obedience to the Church, and do an act of Religion that may either acquire or recover me a friend to the merits of Monſieur <hi>de Saint Germain.</hi> It is not poſſible for me to hate him, being as I am a member of the body of the Faithful: and if I had not eſteem'd him, I ſhould not be in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the reaſonable. Oblige me therefore by aſſuring him of my affection and reſpects, after you have told him that I have ſent you my injuries and my reſentments to be laid upon the altar whereon he makes his vowes and ſacrifices; that is, the Altar of Peace and Love, he muſt offer on it both for himſelf and me, all our froward paſſions, and all the ſowreneſs and bitterneſs of our ſpirits. I am reſolved not to contribute to the continuance of diſorder, or nouriſh my ſelf with the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of gall, nor grow old in a bad conſtance. You may adde as many civilities as you pleaſe to this Chriſtian proteſtation. I make this univerſall profeſſion to you, that I am without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>

                  <p>I Have received an infinite number of favours from your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and I have an infinite gratitude for them. But the miſchiefe is, there is none that knowes it beſides my ſelfe. I have been ſo farre from oſtentation of my good fortune, that I have enjoyed it as a thing gotten by theft, and it ſeemes have taken a courſe to poſſeſſe it without witneſſes, that I might keep it without envy. You may call it either covetouſneſſe, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, ſeeking ſecurity, or avoiding Spectators: I am ſure, Sir, I have kept ſilence with as much Religion as if you had <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ'd</hi> to me all the civilities you have written: and I cannot deny, that unleſſe you have the gift of reading thoughts, you
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170361:92"/> muſt needs be very diſſatisfi'd with the care you have taken to oblige a man that does not ſpeak. Yet I muſt, at length, juſtifie my ſelfe, and help you to divine the true cauſe of this ſilence. It is moſt certaine, my reſentments had not been impriſon'd thus long in my breaſt, but becauſe I knew not whither to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe them to you: for you have ſo many Houſes, in ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Provinces, that nothing was more eaſie then to miſſe you when you are aimed at, and miſtake the Earldom for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſate. Now you are fixed, Sir, and are to be found in the Caſtle which the Fairies built for your Anceſtours on the banks of the <hi>Dordoigne,</hi> I beſeech you, gently admit theſe lines to preſent my reſpects to you, and aſſure you of a fidelity as pure and ſincere —. I could with I had my ſelfe been the bearer of theſe aſſurances, to have paſſed with you the happy dayes which my affection promiſed me there. But this cannot be accompliſh'd only with deſires and paſſions, though Monſieur <hi>Deſportes</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called them the <hi>feet of the ſoul.</hi> I muſt move more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially, and with more ſtrength: if God do not take compaſſion of my weakeneſs, I am afraid I ſhall take no more journies, but in the Mappe. I expect, therefore, by Monſieur — a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full relation of the pleaſures which I ſhould have taſted, had I been capable to receive them. I will comfort my ſelfe by his aſſiſtance, with that harveſt of Orange flowers and Jaſſamine, which is gathered in my abſence. I will read the Diary of that warre, we ſhould have both been at in a Coach, and I ſhall know the number of the ſlaine, whoſe Epitaphs we ſhould have made after dinner: I meane your Harts, your wild Boares, and your Salmons, which are taken in ſuch aboundance, as I am told, that there is no day in the yeare but you might feaſt <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and his Miſtriſs —.

In doing me the honour hereby of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating me from the people, you deſire I ſhould ſee that though I am not one of your judges, I am one of thoſe of whoſe voice you account, and whoſe opinion you do not contemne. At firſt, my Lord, and without deliberation my vote was for you. I judged you worthy of your good fortune before it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell you, and ſeeming a very juſt man from the firſt time I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved you, I did not think it any miracle that you ſhould become fortunate, or that the choice of a goddeſs hath crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Graces of Heaven. All that has been attempted to trouble the ſucceſſe of this envied election, hath done nothing but bred occaſion for you to triumph over envy; and you draw this advantage from your paines, and conteſts, that in a poſſeſſion, which was too peaceable for ſo deſired a good, there is now neer as much ſplendor as ſweetneſs, and ſomething that reſembles conqueſt, after your victory in Parliament. It was

He told me nothing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, but I deſired him to repeate it; and mentioned nothing of vows but what deſerved this complement of the Academy Italian, <hi>Di gratia Signor un altra <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olta:</hi> But particularly the deſcription of the feaſt, you made Monſieur <hi>Chavigny,</hi> was acted over more then once at my moſt humble ſupplication. I found in it I know not what of learned Antiquity. But on your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Sir, was that <hi>Terence</hi> which was ſerved in for one of your ſweet-meats, ſo ſtuck with perfumes and covered with flowers, abſolutely of your owne invention? Is it not an Originall of <hi>Maecenos,</hi> or at leaſt that gallant man of the following Century, <hi>qui deliciarum arbiter, &amp; cujus eruditus luxus à nostro Cornelio cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bratur?</hi> How ever it be, we never heard of ſuch cates before, and you wanted nothing that day, but <hi>Dionyſius Lambinus</hi> for cook, and <hi>Adrian Turnebus</hi> for Steward. The piece is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingenious, and much more humane and rationall then the deſire of that Barbarous Graecian, who at <hi>Alexanders</hi> table wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a Satrapa's head in a diſh. This was a reſemblance of the haughtineſs of <hi>Turky,</hi> before there were any Turks in the world: and it is an example only fit for <hi>Machiavell</hi>'s imitation, if he had invited <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> to dinner. But you are to deal with a man, who hath the palat of Roman Conſuls, and not Aſian Princes: and you have accordingly treated him after the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man faſhion; for it muſt be confeſſed, that the appetite <hi>of his mind</hi> could not be better repreſented, by an embleme more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, nor more gallant then that you had deviſed. When if you make him a ſecond Entertainment I have entreated our friends to give you a preſent from me, and deliver you ſome Latine verſes, of the laſt inſpiration of my Muſes; they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ragouſts of <hi>Scipio,</hi> nor the delicacies of <hi>Mecaenas:</hi> yet they are fruits tranſplanted from the nurſery of thoſe happy Ages; and I have inſerted my grafts upon their Stocks.

                  <p>IF I did not know that Generoſity takes delight in ſpeaking improperly, and thinks it owes that which it gives, I ſhould not underſtand the intentions of Monſieur your brother. His converſation hath diſpelled the clouds of my melancholly: his quittance hath melted the ſtubbornneſſe of my ſoul: he hath been my interceſſour to the Commiſſary; he hath ſhewed me one of your Sermons: and after all this, he thanks me for all the good turnes he has done me, and will not make me happy without being obliged to me for it. And yet more, Sir, he would have this conceit of obligation extend even to you, and diſturbe you in the middle of your conflicts, that I might receive a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement from that hand which ſtrikes dead Hereſie. Here is enough to ſatisfie the moſt ambitious ſpirit in the world. One graine of your incenſe is worth a maſſe of anothers, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo ſweet, even in the ſenſe of wiſe Antiquity, as the praiſes that come from a perſon that is univerſally commended. They that contemne the acclamations of the people, ſhould yet be ſenſible of theſe; which cannot be indifferent to any, but ſuch as honour their ſullen humour with the Title of Stoick Philoſophy. For my part, Sir, I declare my ſelfe to be none of that ſect, every kind of allurement would not be apt to tempt me: but how is it poſſible to abſtaine from a meat which you have dreſſed, or reſiſt a paſſion, that workes its effect by your Language? So that I muſt needs tell you freely, I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more joy then when I received your Letter. Monſieur <hi>de la Thibaudiere</hi> was a witneſſe of my traunce: Monſieur <hi>Chaplain</hi> had notice of my good newes: if it were poſſible I would have divulged it to all the Earth, and have printed it in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, that all ſuch as can read might know, I am moſt paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately,</p>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170361:95"/> from a braine yet unſetled from yeſterdayes tempeſt; that I now expect a fift Fit? It would be injurious to the worth of the excellenteſt Letter in the world, and to intimate to you, that it hath not abſolutely cured me, or that it leaves any work behind for Phyſick or time: it would be too ungratefull a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me of your favours, ſo rare and exquiſite, and which have ſo ſenſibly obliged me, yet I muſt alleadge the diſturbance of my head, to juſtifie the little premeditation I am capable of, and the negligence of this ſcrowle. It will aſſure you, Sir, that there is no body ſo poſſeſſed with the Divell of a Tertian ague; but the ſound of your words bring him ſome eaſe: there are no eyes ſo greedy of ſleep, but love your Letters better then their reſt. I never ſaw ſo much beauty, ſo many ornaments, and ſo much riches in one place: and yet in the middle of this faire aboundance, you complaine of being poore. Ask God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for that ſinfull word. It cannot proceed from any thing but either an extream ambition or an inſatiable avarice: and you put me in mind of him who reckoned the treaſuries of <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> nothing, who ſlighted the tributes of the Indies and <hi>Aſia,</hi> who did not think he had enough when he had all. You ought not Sir, to bewaile your poverty: you ſhould reforme your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and profuſeneſs. For my particular you give me ſo much, that I have not roome enough to receive your benefits: and they are ſo unfit for me that I dare not touch them with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane hands. I make a conſcience of appropriating things ſo high and diſproportionable to my meaneneſſe. I have no right to receive them, unleſſe you have power to force me to it, unleſſe you compell my humility as the Pope did that of father <hi>Lugo,</hi> who would not have accepted the Purple but only to avoid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. What ever it be, Sir, and whatſoever acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent menaces good fortunes, I hope to preſerve the Principle of mine, I meane your favour. And for this, I ſhall be deficient neither in paſſion nor reſpect; and if Time undeceive you in that counterfeit Grandee whom you eſteem ſo highly in my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, you ſhall find at leaſt, an honeſt man in the place of him, whom time can never change, and whom doubtleſſe, you will ever love, ſince he will eternally be with all his ſoul,</p>

                  <p>YOu will not be offended, that I valew the acceſſory higher then the principall, and your Letter then your preſent. You have ſent me a book I do not much admite, but you have written I know not what that charmes me. Pardon the curioſity of a man, on whom you have made triall of your enchantments; I deſire of you ſeriouſly, Where is this innocent and handſom Magick taught? or, if you pleaſe, that ſubtle and new kind of Rhetorick. In that Country, from whence the <hi>Genus Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strativum</hi> comes to us, and in the ſhapes of Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglic,</hi> and the father <hi>Strada:</hi> there is not any myſtery taught to attract the ſoul more gently, and by more delicate engines. Your ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities are perfumed with an incenſe ſo exquiſite and precious, that that which is retailed at Court, is but a ſophiſticate Gum in reſpect of it. In a word, Sir, to expreſſe my ſelfe literally, without making uſe of the figures and Rhetorick I have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from you; you imploy ſo much of your own Eloquence in praiſing mine, that you ſeeme rather to defie that, then make a complement to me. I have no mind, either to conteſt in this, or any thing elſe with you: I bear too much reverence both to the Kings ſervant, and his Tongue, and am too ſenſible of the advantage he hath over me; who the laſt yeare perſwaded what he would, and whom I hearkened to with delight, when he gave his anſwers upon two hundred queſtions that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd him. I am reſolved to hear and applaud as long as I live, to give place and yield to you as much as you pleaſe: for it were better, I ſhould paſſe for one of your Paradoxes, than, with words ſo unequall to yours, attempt to confute you to my own confuſion. Why ſhould I perplexe my ſelf to reſiſt a ſtrength which is nothing but gentleneſs, and can do nothing but good? I muſt patiently endure my happineſſe. In <hi>Egypt</hi> they do not caſt up bankes againſt that beneficiall violence, which breakes in to enrich the Country that receives it: Be pleaſ d therefore to continue your pleaſing exceſſes, and over-preſſe me with an infinity of favours. I ſhall be glorious in thoſe precious ruines: write excellent things to me ſtill whileſt I only returne an anſwer to them in the bare proteſtation, which I ſhall make you, to be ever paſſionately,</p>

                  <p>I Have been ſlow in anſwering your eloquent Letter, but the reaſon is becauſe I have ruminated and meditated upon its Eloquence a long time. There are enchanted papers as well as Caſtles, and if I have forgot my ſelf amongſt your excellent things, do not eſteem it ſloath, but rather an extaſie and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment. That which you have written to me, does honour to the memory of your Prince, and extolls his judgment after his death. I perceive by that, he underſtood how to chooſe heads and diſtinguiſh of men: that he was as knowing in pens as ſwords; that his Secretaries did not ſecond him leſſe gallantly in his Cloſet, then his Colonells in the field. But do not think you ſhall be ridde of me ſo, in ſhewing me you were worthy to be the Duke of <hi>Weymar's</hi> Secretary: you promiſed me more, that you would be his Hiſtoriographer for my ſake, and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the <hi>Memoires</hi> I requeſted of you. In the meane time, Sir, I thank you for the Sermons you have taken the paines to ſend me, and beſeech you to aſſure the honeſt Heretick that preached them, that I alwaies extreamly honour and eſteem him. There is more then one Right Reverend, and one Regent Maſter amongſt us, that I ſhould be very glad our Church could truck for ſo deſerving an enemy. Not that we want famous perſons, but I could wiſh there were none famous in the world but who were ours; and it troubles me, I am forced to commend a valour that makes warre upon us. It is moſt certaine, I cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from praiſing that Monſieur <hi>Daillé,</hi> yea in the preſence of the Jeſuites my ſpirituall fathers, and the Capuchins my deare friends. I every day envy him your Party, and ſometimes I tell him, though he can hardly heare me where he is, <hi>Cum talis fis, utinam noster eſſes?</hi> Will you be ſo faithfull as to carry him this amorous ſigh from me? it makes its addreſſes alſo to you who very well merit our deſires; and I beſeech you, receive it with my proteſtation to be alwayes in ſincerity,</p>

                  <p>YOu are too good in pittying my ſolitude, and awaking me out of my drouzineſs by a name ſo dear to me as yours. I was raviſhed to find it at the end of thoſe curious lines that preceded it: curious, indeed, if ever I read any; for without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſigne to irritate the goddeſs of flowers, or the god of light, I maintain there can be nothing more gloriouſly enamelled nor more radiant then what you write. But from whence do you gather all theſe riches? You make but few journyes into the Latin Country, and very rarely in to <hi>Greece?</hi> Without doubt you take all theſe rich materialls of the Univerſal Idea of things: your ſoul is naturally inſtructed and diſciplined, and you become learned in the ſame manner as the firſt Inventours of Arts and Sciences. I am confident, that excellent man you tell me of, is of my opinion, and that nights converſation you two had togerher in the walls of Saint <hi>Germans,</hi> ſhew'd him, that common underſtanding well-managed can outſtrip Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and that there was juſt occaſion for a Dialogue, where it may be, he had provided a Lecture. I exceedingly approve the eloquent homages you do him in your Letter to him? I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the high things, you ſpeak concerning the ſuperiority of his wit: and that ſilver Coller which you promiſe to weare as the badge of your ſervitude, is a rare piece in my conceite. I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much eſteem, Sir, the good Counſels you have given to our Monſieut <hi>de la</hi> — if he reſolve to follow them, no heart can eſcape him, and we ſhall ſee as many <hi>Chloriſes</hi> and <hi>Philliſes</hi> as he can catch in his nets. O the gallant Inamora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and youthfull Doctor of Love? When ſhall I make up the third in your ſociety? It cannot be till you both come hither; for in the conſideration I am, good fortune muſt come ſeek me, and caſt her ſelf into my armes. In the mean time, I beſeech you continue your hearty love to me, if you will have me live with any comfortably in expectation of you, and believe me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I beſeech you,</p>

                  <p>YOu did not allow me time to expect the good which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. Almoſt at the ſame inſtant that I wiſh'd for manna from <hi>Sedan,</hi> I ſaw it rain in my deſart: and the cloud broke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the banks of <hi>Charante,</hi> when I thought the vapour began but to exhale from the ſtreames of <hi>Meuſe.</hi> Yet ſo rare a preſent is not the principall part of the benefit I have received: the ſpirit with which you animated it, is ſomething, more exquiſite then the gift: I do leſs value your none-ſuch then your eloquence: and contrary to the ordinary courſe, words are here of more worth then things. Give me leave therefore Sir, to renew my old Queſtions to you and to demand, What God hath inſpired you with theſe eloquent words; who hath revealed Rhetorick to you? on what hill have you ſlept, and what lawrell have you eaten? Or have you lighted upon the thoughts of thoſe Philoſophers, and Oratours, whoſe books you never read? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly your ſouls have ſeen and diſcourſed with one another in the other world, before yours came into this. You muſt have conferred together in the Cloſet, from whence celeſtiall origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, and the firſt formes of things do iſſue, for your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them muſt come from a farther place then mine. If it be ſo, me thinks you have lately put your ſelf to a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> expence. What will you do with that perpetuall whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, that chatters out Porphyries five <hi>Predicables,</hi> and that Hackney Grammarian, who betrayes <hi>Cicero</hi> every time he goes about to tranſlate him to him? Retrench your retinew of thoſe two unprofitable mouths, and continue to ſearch narrowly within your ſelf, where I promiſe you, you will find excellent things. It is betetr to be rich by birth, then ceaſe to be a begger by labour: and I eſteem an admirable ignorant as you are, before an ordinary Doctour, ſuch as I know ſtore. But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Queſtion, hath been too long and too often handled. Let us therefore conclude it with that faire picture, which you have drawn in your Letter: and do you fancy that young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who diſpenſes good and ill dayes at her pleaſure, and who without ſtirring from her mothers houſe, ſcatters fire over all <hi>France:</hi> fancy her, I ſay, either comming out of her bed, or from bathing, without a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170361:98"/> lawne, nay without her ſmock, if you be but valiant enough to endure ſuch an apparition, and ſee her as naked as when ſhe came into the world. On the other ſide, imagine to your ſelf that Lady who ha's the prodigious memory, who is the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of ſeverall Kingdomes, who groanes under the burden of faſhions and <hi>gugewes,</hi> who hath all <hi>Medaeaes</hi> receits for paſtes, oyles, and eſſences. To which of theſe two, think you, would the inclination of a ſoul that knew how to chuſe, runne firſt? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which would a man of a ſound judgment, and good eyes moſt willingly proſtrate himſelf? There would be no great ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the choice, Sir, and by the ſame ſentence, your divine couſen and your ſelfe have carried your cauſe: but I am not of opinion to venture my ſelf any further, though you would lead me. I am extreamly apprehenſive of ridiculous deſignes and adventures; and my gray haires drive me from that banquet your good nature invites me to. I leave you then, the Phoenix, the eighth wonder of the World, the utmoſt atchievement of nature, and all the reſt of the hardwords, of which you would have had me make an Oration, contenting my ſelf to end this Letter in the ſimplicity of familiar language, and telling you acording to my cuſtome, that I am perfectly.</p>

                  <p>IF your paſſion be as true as it is eloquent, and kindle as great a flame in your own breaſt as it caſts luſtre in your words, with the favour of <hi>Socrates,</hi> I am the moſt happy Lover that ever courted beautious ſouls. Within a little ſpace, I have found a thouſand rayes of that firſt, and ſoveraign <hi>Faire,</hi> which all the ancient Philoſophy ſought after: and you can ſo well repreſent what you happily conceive, that had you given me no more then this picture, I ſhould have already received too much. But it is not your intention I ſhould only be happy in figure: you do not deſigne to bedeck me with a new <hi>nothing</hi> nor make a largeſs of falſe money. Your Colours are ſolid and your appearances <hi>eſsentiall:</hi> and without Queſtion you have profeſſed to me the fervency of your love in the Ornaments of your lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, to no other end but that I may ſee truth is not alwaies plain and poorly clad, but that ſhe hath her feaſtivalls, and actions of Ceremony. Can any thing be imagined more gallant and yet more paſſionate then this devotion of yours, and thoſe vows which you continually pay, in the Church where we firſt ſaw one another? The ſecreſie and the ſolitude which you fought out to enjoy, apart from witneſſes, the paper which Monſieur Chaplain lent you, obliges me to cry out <hi>Hony ſoit qui mal y penſe,</hi> and advertize the prophane people, that virtue weares ſometimes the countenance of vice, and our Muſes ceaſe not to be chaſte, though they are voluptuous. But what ſhall I ſay to your ſhutting the door, and fortifying your ſelf
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170361:99"/> in your chamber that no body might diſturbe you in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a dozen of lines? The long, and greedy kiſſes, you beſtowed on the paper that wore my name, and the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſenſuall pleaſures, to which your ſpirit, yielded it ſelf, when you read my teſtimony of your merit are farre from the actions of a diſſembler, and can never poſſibly ſeem ſuch to me though I ſaw them only written, and in the Relation I received. The fabulous <hi>Pilades</hi> and <hi>Orestes</hi> cannot be ſo lively acted, nor the two <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> in the ſtory. For my part, I having ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> and a little acquaintance with formes and Ideas, do maintaine there is no Rhetorick but the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that can ſpeak in that ſtyle: and that is the true, and natural ſtrain of noble affection. Mine being more ſtrong then handſome, I do not venture to wrappe it up in a delicate ſtyle. I know not how to anſwer a Relation which I can only admire, and you ſhall be contented, if you pleaſe with vulgar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: but ſuch as I do warrant every ſyllable of them in their moſt Rigorous ſignification, proteſting to you that I am,</p>

                  <p>YOu are not contented only to beſtow your own affection on me, and place me in your heart: you labour for me elſewhere, and ceaſe not either to acquire or preſerve me illuſtrious friends Is it true wch you write of Monſieur the Embaſſadour of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and am I happy enough to be eſteemed by him? I ſpeak this to you as religiouſly as if I touch'd the altars whereon we ſwore our friendſhip: My ambition was dead, but you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored it to life againe, and I ſhould have the ſame extaſies as you, were but my blood as ſubtle and ſpiritful in my veines. Who would not think himſelfe glorious by his eſteem, of whoſe birth our Age ha's cauſe to be proud? He is a Living one, whom the Preſident <hi>Jannin</hi> oppoſ'd to all the dead Grandees of Antiquity, and had <hi>Holland</hi> brought forth no more then this learned head, our deare friend is to blame: ſhe had deſerved alone all the laurells he would diſpoil the reſt of. For Meſſieurs <hi>du Puy</hi> you cannot believe what good you have done me, in telling me they alwayes love me, and that my ſloath hath not forfeited their
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170361:99"/> favour: For though Monſieur <hi>L' Huillier</hi> ha's engaged for me, and undertaken to preſerve me in their remembrance, yet I ſhould not have left all to him, and been deficient in a duty, which is payed them in all Languages, and from all places of the Earth. Nevertheleſs if you pleaſe to aſſociate with that admirable Monſieur <hi>l'Huillier,</hi> and act joyntly in my name, who makes any queſtion but they had rather hear you, then read me, and that my Agents would be valewed more then either I or my Letters? Oblige me therefore to let them know, Sir, but this from your eloquent mouth, that they have not cheriſh'd a ſavage, and that he who received their favours is a <hi>Denizen</hi> of the civilized world, capable of gratitude, and who both knowes and is ſenſible of a benefit beſtowed on him. If it were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as hard to bring me to <hi>Paris,</hi> as to bring <hi>Paris</hi> hither to me, I would willingly eaſe you of this Commiſſion, and be my ſelf the bearer of my complement. In truth, though <hi>Paris</hi> have many allurements to make it be deſirable, and though the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the State be not only contracted there in the perſon of the Prince, but diffuſ'd into as many parts as there are Courts of Juſtice; yet all this greatneſs, and all this Majeſty cannot tempt me to return thither again. It is not the Louvre that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractes me thither, it is the Cloſet of thoſe excellent brothers: and the fortune I ſeek, hath nothing in it but pure, ſpirituall, and learned: I am neither Courtier, Lawyer, nor Uſurer. I am ignorant in all knowledge of theſe profeſſions: but out of all that ignorance, there is found a certain animall, extreamly free and indifferently reaſonable, who hath not been diſliked by Monſieur the Embaſſadour of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who hath formerly been acceptable to Meſſieurs <hi>du Puy,</hi> and whom you may now prize to them, at what rate you pleaſe. I do not implore you to enrich the definition of me, to valew me at more then I am worth: I only beſeech you not to forget what really I am ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of, and to perſwade even your ſelfe, (for with you I have moſt need of your good offices) that I can love without intereſt: that my tenderneſs is firme and conſtant, that I am a Violent that laſts, that is, that I ſhall be all my life, with paſſion,</p>

                  <p>SInce it is infinitely beyond my power to returne a ſutable anſwer to the favourable Relations I received from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Chapelain,</hi> what can I do but deſpaire as to my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of ſo many ſolid effects and ſenſible obligations as I have received from your goodneſſe? You take too much care to preſerve that which you cannot loſe: my paſſion is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable thing you are Maſter of; it is withall the moſt aſſured. The miſchiefe is, that having reſerv'd nothing of my ſelf when firſt I made you the gift, I have nothing now left to offer you; and I very well perceive that at the ſame time you intend to ſhew your own power and my diſability. I was immediately drained of my complements, but your favours are inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and whoſoever ſhall underſtand that your impriſonment in <hi>Germany</hi> did not bereave you of the meanes to oblige me there, will not wonder that your Government of <hi>Angoumois</hi> affords you occaſions to do it. During your confinement you entertain'd your ſolitude with me in your thoughts: In a time of melancholly you conceived me capable to divert you, yea my only name and image have ſerv'd to do it: and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote as I was from you, I made ſuch rayes of joy ſtreame into your ſoul as cauſ'd an admirable and glorious ſpring in it. I preſerve my Lord, the bundle of thoſe excellent flowers it brought forth with much care: I bedeck my ſelf and flatter my vanity with them. I look upon them as the faireſt token of remembrance that <hi>Polybius</hi> could have wiſhed from his <hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> from his Marqueſſe of <hi>Peſcara.</hi> It is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome deſigne of Heaven, or ſome good preſage that this Marqueſſe is come into my mind. Since you are not leſſe brave then he, it is juſt you be not leſſe happy. The <hi>Victoria Colonna</hi> of our age muſt compleat your felicity, ſince vertue hath begun it. There are no wiſhes to be made for you, after theſe. And though the preſent I have received from you be ſomething more obliging then the grant of Exemptions and Protections, or then the Majoralty of <hi>Angouleſme</hi> and that of <hi>Saintes</hi> which you have conferr'd at my inſtance; yet I think my ſelf ſufficiently grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if I prognoſticate with ſucceſſe the poſſeſſion of a good which you eſteem infinitely higher then all others. It hath
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170361:100"/> hitherto been in vain deſired: God hath refuſed it to the prayers and devotion of men: But without doubt, you are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the ſecret of Providence to be the happy poſſeſſour of it. Believe me, my Lord: I have been inſpired more then once, and I tell you in the name of Heaven, and in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of my Oracles, <hi>Tua tua erit, et ſua te propter eſſe deſinet. Tu certè dignus es quem ipſa Minerva praeferat &amp; virginitati &amp; fibi.</hi> I dare not adde any thing to theſe high words, and cannot better conclude my Letter then with a Prophecie.

                  <p>YOur remembrance is not a bare token of your civility: You remember me in termes that perſwade me although they come from a ſuſpected place, and that I know, at Court words are not much uſed but to diſguiſe intentions. You uſe them with greater integrity, and more faithfull to the intent of nature. They are the faire interpreters of your ſoul; and in your Letters, the repreſentation of the thing is no other then the thing it ſelf. You love, my Lord, where ever you have ſaid it; and your word gives me firmer aſſurance of my good then my poſſeſſion of it. I repoſe confidence in that, who have reaſon to diſtruſt the decrees of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and in whom ſo many Oracles have proved lyars. I am not a little proud to find room in a memory, which uſually is ſtored with Orders from the King, and determinate reſolutions of the Councell. But I am much more glorious in being beloved by a man that looks on all Employments, and charges, beneath him who makes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious profeſſion of Probity and honour, whom the Court hath not been able to effeminate, nor War to exaſperate. I think I have ſaid all in this. For is it not a little miracle to eſcape without flying, from the contagion of a corrupted Age; to have more true ſtrength, then cuſtome hath violence; to know how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage fury, and mixe the Man with the Lyon; to be vertuous, rationall, wiſe, amidſt the tumult of unchained paſſions? And in this place you muſt, if it pleaſe you, pardon me the liberty I am about to take, and permit me to demand of you, whether
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170361:101"/> you alwayes intend to employ Reaſon to a uſe that ſeems ſo contrary to her? Will you ever exerciſe an Art ſo mortall to the quiet of the World?

It may be, a milder ſeaſon will ſucceed this, and heaven may be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to earth; poſſibly the future reſerves ſome good dayes for us, and all our feaſtivalls are not extinct: In caſe it ſhould be ſo, you will have leiſure to let us ſee you in your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that is at leaſt one fruit of the peace which I hope to gather on the banke of our fair <hi>Charante.</hi> I do not tell you in her behalfe and as her Poet, that the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Danow</hi> make her jealous: I ſpeak of my own head, that I impatiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the honour of kiſſing your hands, and am more then any perſon in the World,</p>

                  <p>YOu have obliged me with ſo much goodneſs in the affaires of others, that I cannot doubt your aſſiſtance in my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and moſt ſenſible intereſts.

I would at leaſt once in my life, offer you my devoirs more nobly, and without blemiſh to the purity of my paſſion by this troubleſome mixture of buſineſs that accompanies it. But on the other ſide, me thinks, it would have ſomething of Pride in it, to be unwilling to owe you much; &amp; your protection is ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that I am not troubled to be more yours every day, by ſome new title which you acquire over me. Whom ſhould we invoke in our calamities but him that effectually hearkens to us? and to whom ſhall we addreſſe our prayers, but to a power that is beneficent to all? but to the tutelar Saint of our Province, and our peculiar Protectour? Preſerve us therefore Sir, from the dreadfull harraſſes of Barretry that menace us. Which after it hath defrauded us of what our lawfull right was not ſtrong enough to maintaine, would now ſnatch that from us which the remorſe of our judges hath left us. I do not accuſe their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, though I cannot commend their judgment, I only ſay, to cleare them, that oftentimes falſhood has a better appearance then truth. I ſee very evidently the fictions of Lawyers are more dangerous then thoſe of Poets, and the Sophiſms of <hi>Normandy</hi> harder to reſolve then thoſe of the Latin Country. If you pleaſ'd but to diſcourſe upon this matter with any of our Commiſſioners, I make no queſtion but being inſpired by your words he would receive a new ſpirit for the good of our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the effect of his inſpiration be immediately infuſed on all his Aſſociates. The reverence of your vertue, would make them conſider more exactly the goodneſs of our cauſe, you —, and will be the chiefe Authour of the conſolation we expect. I conjure you, to do us this favour, and believe me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,</p>

He made me a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, and he detaines me from being a ſavage.

                  <p>THere is a certain Spirit of Barretry and a ſhe divell of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits which fills the world with diſorders. The Poets were overſeen in not reckoning her among their Harpuies and Furies: they ought to have made her one of their miſcheivous deityes, and ſhould have given her terrible Talons, and armed her with Torches and Serpents. You know, Sir, this enemy of humane quiet, hath tormented our friend a long time: but, it may be, you do not know that ſhe will torment him eternally, unleſſe you compaſſionate his miſeries, and become his abſolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. I can neither doubt of your affection to your friends, nor your influence over the minds of the judges: I have had too particular experiences of them, and Suitours have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given me thanks for carrying the cauſes I have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to you. That which troubles me a little, is an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion leſt my Letter ſhould not find you at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and that we ſhould by your abſence loſe the advantages your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe makes me hope. Yet on the other ſide, this apprehenſion cannot make any deep impreſſion for there is ſome probability that at leaſt in the middle of <hi>February,</hi> or the Latter end of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, your Campagne may be ended. It hath laſted longer then thoſe of any of our Generalls: and unleſs you meane to paſſe in the Hall for one that ha's left the Barre, there is no queſtion but you will be by that time return'd to reſume your long robe. If it be ſo, our cauſe will be better by half: for though we have many contrivances and Engines, yet what uſe are they of, without an ingineer that underſtands how to manage them? I conjure you to be the ſpirit to animate and infuſe heat to the reſt, and do me the favour to believe that you ſhall never oblige a Suppliant more of readier gratitude, nor more truly then my ſelf,</p>

                  <p>DId not friendſhip juſtifie whatſoever is her own action, I ſhould this day be guilty of a ſtrange errour, and it would ſeem a ſort of riddle; that one that was recommended to you by Monſieur <hi>Maynard</hi> ſhould now recommend Monſieur <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> to you: for his firſt complement it would be (if taken lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) a very peremptory piece of extravagance, the Hiſtory of <hi>Tholoze</hi> would record my addreſſe to the Prince of the Senate, but not much to my commendation, and thoſe which treat of the doctrine of Manners would quote it in the Chapter of Good-Carriage as a prodigy newly hapned in the rationall world. This would be the conſequence, Sir, were my action meaſured by the rules of common Morality: But according to the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will not prejudice your time of publique audiences with my addreſſes. You ſhall be ſuffer'd to act the God on Earth, loſing my ſelfe in the crowd of affaires which aſcend with you into the Tribunall.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> I do not think you would be ſtrong enough, though you have all the fortitude of <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Phocion,</hi> to reſiſt what I would procure him to tell you in favour of our cauſe. This worthy Prelate was formerly my ſword and buckler in the Kingdome of <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Albertus Magnus:</hi> and if my name is yet remaining in the nature of things after ſo many conſpiracies
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170361:104"/> againſt it, and ſo many deſignes fram'd to ſurpreſs it, a great part of the obligation is due to him. From whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he ſeldom ſpeaks but he perſwades: for if he have for my ſake, tamed the moſt ſavadge Doctours of Chriſtendome, the <hi>Phalariſſes</hi> and <hi>Dionyſiuſſes</hi> of the Schools, it is probable he will not have much difficulty to recommend a perſon effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to you who already is in ſome favour with you, and an interceſſour from the Muſes to their <hi>Apollo.</hi> When I call you by that name; I conceive I ſpeak moſt appoſitely: you inherit it from Father to Son, and it is not a new title, that you have brought into your houſe. Oracles have ever been delivered from thence by two different Divinities, and I do not look upon it only as a Veine of Purple, but alſo as a Nurſery of Lawrells. Upon my conſcience, Sir, and if I have any skill in Lawrels, thoſe which I ſaw by Monſieur <hi>Maynards</hi> meanes are the moſt lively and verdant, and goodlieſt to weave into Chaplets, that have this long time been gathered on the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin hills. But is it poſſible that Monſieur your Father, that is a Frenchman of this latter Century writ things ſo pure and Roman? Can it come to paſs that a Poet of our Age ſhould be ſo powerfully poſſeſſed with the Genius of Antiquity? Were I not aſſured that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgil</hi> was not acquainted with Saint <hi>Sernin,</hi> and Saint <hi>Papoul,</hi> I ſhould attribute that excellent Poem to him, in which there is no Hemiſtick but beares the Character of his ſtyle; and if he could poſſibly have lived till this time till ſome enchanted Caſtle of an unknown Iſland, I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he had been baptized in the yeare, one thouſand ſixe hundred and ten: and affirme that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgil</hi> being lately conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Chriſtian Religion, had made Hymnes to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Tholouſe.</hi> But we muſt not aſcribe that glory on a Spectre which is due to a bleſſed ſoul, and ſuch as in the place where he now is may preſide over all compoſitions and ſtudies. We may take him for one of our Patrones both in proſe &amp; verſe, and for one of the tutelar Saints of our Art: if he continue (as it is credible) to love thoſe exerciſes in the other world, which were dear to him in this; He will Queſtionly take part with the Oratours and Poets that are now all in confuſion; he will ſide with the intereſts of our publique ſociety, that implores either your juſtice or favour. To this moſt powerfull recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and requeſt made immediately from Heaven, ſhall I dare to annexe my poor and frivolous labours? they are two diſcourſes, not diſapproved at Court, and which you will read
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170361:105"/> perhaps with ſome delight though ſuch as I entreat you to look upon only as written at the inſtance of a friend. He will preſent them to you from me with a comment of his own, and beſide relate you the occurrences of the deſart where he has been, ſince your curioſity doth not contemne what paſſes in it: and when you have ſeen in what manner you are celebrated there, and in what veneration I hold your vertue, he will not faile to give you his teſtimony of my zeal and reſpects, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you that I am, and will ever be perfectly all my life,</p>

You draw glory from an adventure which is much more glorious for me then you. The Lady that treated you as my favourite in the walks of <hi>Luxembourge</hi> has done me an honour in which you have ſo ſmall a ſhare, that it was humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in you not to have rejected her Complement.

I cannot be known to the world by a definition that delights me more then this, <hi>This is he that is ſo great a Lover and admirer of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur l'<hi>Huillier.</hi> What a goodly property is this to diſtinguiſh me from an infinite number of writers of ſcurvy proſe, and bad verſe, as well as I! Do not miſtruſt the verity of my words; for were I of worth enough, to recommend men by the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have for them, or if I durſt give atteſtations of their vertue as <hi>Justus Lipſius</hi> uſ'd to do; after I had treated you with many magnificent ſuperlatives, I would informe all preſent and all to come, that you are one of my deareſt and moſt violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; that I am the rivall, but a very zealous one, of thoſe bleſſed <hi>Chaplains, Menages,</hi> &amp;c. who poſſeſſe you in my abſence.

I will comfort my ſelf with your Letter, for the happineſs I am depriv'd of in the loſs of your converſation, and will wiſh you more ſuch adventures as thoſe in <hi>Luxembourge,</hi> that from time to time ſome fair tongue may advertiſe you that I am more then any perſon in the World,</p>

                  <p>YOU are alwayes either doing or procuring me good: you intercede for me, when you do not give; and my riches flow from your goodneſs, either as from their fountain or in their
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170361:106"/> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell: I call thoſe things riches which you ſent me from <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe I now know no other. My ſoul being cured of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and having never ſo much as been ſick of avarice, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the employments nor dignities of your world can tempt me in the deſart: I am no way pregnable but by the ſpirit, and covetous only or goods purely ſpirituall. So that I judge I have received more grace from Monſieur the Cardinall <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> in the clauſe of a Letter, then he could have done me by a load of Bulls, though the ring of the Fiſher had been the Seal of them. How dextrous is this Prince in winning men! how learned in the art of obliging! what delight there is in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him! It is a way to ſee him do miracles, to make him change the ſmalleſt and vileſt things that are offered him, into great and precious. Upon reading the words he hath written to you concerning me, me thinks, Sir, I am no more my ſelf. I believe I am one of <hi>Augustus</hi> Court, and my verſes are as vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as thoſe of <hi>Virgil;</hi> I imagine I have been crowned in the Capitoll, I know not how many Ages before <hi>Petrarch</hi> received that honour. In the extaſie I am tranſported to, by ſo high a Generoſity, and which hath made ſo low a deſcent, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to grow higher without running into extravagance. And that is done already, unleſſe you pleaſe to ſtyle that Enthuſiaſme, which they who ſpeak properly would call Frenzy. But ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing there be a reaſonable fury, yet the motions of it not being in their right place, when in a Letter, I intend to reſerve them for my Latine compoſitions, and a Hymne to the God which hath inſpired me. In the meane time, be pleaſ'd to be my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour to him, and beſides, my ſecurity in another place that the perſon to whom I confeſſe I owe much, may not doubt upon your word, but that I am very gratefull. But you ever do more then I entreat you: Indeed, you love too nobly; your cares are too punctuall, and your good offices too paſſionate. How ſhall I behave my ſelf in this confuſion, into which your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous friendſhip ha's caſt me? I can only aſſure you, Sir, that of all thoſe you love, there is none who reverences your vertue at that height as I do, nor who is more perfectly then my ſelfe,</p>

                  <p>I Conceive my ſelf injur'd by your exceſſe of modeſty, and I look upon your humility as bad uſage of me. Indeed you treat me too much after the faſhion of the Country, in deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the cauſes of our new acquaintance with ſo much reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and curioſity. Though I am a villager, I am not ſo ſcarce of intelligence, but I know ſome thing from time to time, and have a little commerce with the world. At leaſt I can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by common fame; ſhe flyes hither ſometimes and brings us the names of the Gallant, Wiſe, and Learned which the world eſteemes. You are, Sir, one of thoſe illuſtrious ones, whom I know, by report of the publick voice, and by a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that never flatters. And although Monſieur <hi>de Morin</hi> were nothing to you, and you were not the great confident of the great <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> yet you have parts eſſentially your own, for which you very well deſerve to be regarded. Your vertue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely pure, and ſeperated from all adherences ſhall ever be a moſt worthy object of my paſſion and reſpects. You alone can furniſh me with commendations then, for more than one Senatour, and to make above one Elogium; and do you think it ſtrange yet I ſhould account highly of you? To be Prieſt to ſevere <hi>Themis,</hi> and yet not omit ſacrificing to the Graces, who are leſſe rigid; to receive equall benedictions from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick people, and the Hugue not nation: not to be leſſe Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian or Roman then French, and to be able to deliver your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion both among the <hi>Areopagites</hi> and the fathers Conſcript, with the ſame facility as in the Court of the Edict; Is all this, Sir, but a trifle in the barbariſme of theſe latter ages?

                     <hi>MEnelaus</hi> was contented with the declaration of <hi>Greece</hi> in his favour; But our friend of <hi>Quercey,</hi> looks for more. He conceives all the Earth be concerned in the accuſation which he charges on his wife; certainly, he is much miſtaken, and is not throughly acquainted with mankind. Men jeſt at misfortunes of this nature, in the perſon of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> I meane ſuch men as otherwiſe love <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> very perfectly. They are violences if they be not Tragedies, for they compell people to laugh, unleſſe ſome capitall crime be involv'd in the trick of youth, or there be poyſon mingled with the love. In ſuch caſes, indeed the buſineſs is beyond raillery. The delight of laughter is changed into deteſtation and abhorrence; and theſe two things, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath noted, afford no roome for good language. Out of theſe caſes the publique doth not take the injuries of particulars to heart, one half of the world ſerves for paſtime to the other; what <hi>Titius</hi> calls violating the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of the Lawes, and defiling the purity of Marriage, <hi>Seia</hi> calls it ſport and recreation. Yea ſhe is ſo confident of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of her action that ſhe ſayes it was but juſtice to preferre an honeſt fellow before a Sott. When women delude their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands upon the ſtage, is there any ſpectatour ſo ſevere but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaudes it, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yea, even the Fathers Conſcript, and Roman Matrons are not of his ſide that ſuffers the injury. I can lead you to honeſt <hi>Quintilian,</hi> where you ſhall find in the Chapter <hi>De Riſu</hi> one of theſe ſage Romans, ſeated on the Tribunall. Ask him what he thinks of a man that is ſurprized with his neighbours wife: he will give you no other anſwer but this, that the injur'd perſon was deficient in point of diligence and labour. You may ſee by this, that our frined of <hi>Quercy's</hi> complaints are ſuch as do not move pitty, they are evills no more bemoaned then the Megrime or toothach. Let him therefore conceale that which he can diſcover only to a jeering and unpittying world; and how juſt ſoever his cauſe be, yet reſtraine him from getting ſuch a victory, of which the Garland would diſhonour him. I wiſh him the patience of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> ſince he hath not the good fortune of <hi>Brutus.</hi>

Get him to allow ſome good hours in the night, for it would be too much to demand whole nights. Let him pour upon my eye-lids at evenings, one little drop of that precious liquor, in which he plunges my Laquay over-head and eares. If he will do nothing, and continue peremptory in his rigour, then you have liberty to alter your ſtyle; and to paſs from invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to blaſpheming him.

                  <p>VVEe are indebted to you for the rareſt things in the world. Monſieur <hi>Maynard</hi> ſings them, but it is by meanes of your inſpiration: and it muſt be acknowledg'd that you have either infuſ'd new ſpirits into him, or awakened a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that lay dormant in him. Since he is your Knight, he is become our Maſter, and his ſtrength has encreaſed by half, in the laſt Stanzaes that he writ. He is raiſed above the view of France, in the ſublimity and loſtineſs of his ſtrain: He leaves <hi>Italy</hi> behind him, I mean the witty and eloquent Italy, even in the judgement of the eloquent Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio:</hi> and it would be the greateſt infelicitie, that ever hapned, if he ſhould not winne you, with ſuch a — as has vanquiſhed a nation victorious over all the reſt. Believe my counſell, Madam, I know aſſuredly that your reputation hath raiſed jealouſie in the Cloſets, and divers <hi>Caliſtaes</hi> and <hi>Clorindaes</hi> are envious of the praiſes of <hi>Chloris.</hi> I lately ſaw a diſpatch from Court which ſpeaks of a Widow in this Country that gives out, ſhe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170361:109"/> is <hi>Chloris,</hi> and ſweares the amorous ſtanzaes belong to her. Give the world, Madam, the ſatisfaction of a truth which is ſo important to you, &amp; ſilence the tongue of a preſumptuous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit. Secure your glory and praiſes with ſpeed; and, in a word, take poſſeſſion of the name of <hi>Cloris</hi> by a Solemne act which neither <hi>Cloris</hi> nor <hi>Menander</hi> can undoe again, if they would.

                  <p>It is not to do a favour to a vertue not common, to eſteem it extraordinarily as I do. When I praiſe <hi>Madamoiſelle de Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre,</hi> I am juſt, but not liberall. The Law of Nations would exact the like duty from me, to the perſon of a Spaniſh Lady in the heat of a proclaimed War. So that you muſt not take her upon my teſtimony: that is too much beneath her merit. But my ſuffrage muſt be added to the other commendations that are due to her, and confeſs that ſhe is indowed with modeſty and all the other qualities that beget pride in her ſexe. She made you a ſtrange requeſt, in deſiring you to perſwade me to forget that I had ever ſeen her Letters in the hands of a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that feaſted me with them two hours together. Your way, Sir, to effect this muſt be by the help of Sorcery: you cannot make me forget two ſo happy hours, and ſo dear, to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance with leſs then making me loſe my memory. Have you learned either Magick, or Phyſick enough to reduce me to that condition? Have you as much as will ſend me a diſeaſe like that of the ancient Oratour, who having known all things forgot them all to his own name? You ſee what is the demand

Yet you are ſo good, you would perſwade me that I write you Letters, and that I am eloquent without any intention of mine to be ſo. You profeſs to admire, Madam, what I believe you could not endure, but out of grace and indulgence. If ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable words were not accompanied with more obliging effects, I ſhould conceive ſome ſuſpition they proceeded from the ſpirit of the Court, and that in that part of the Kingdome it was their manner of mockerie.

I might be vain enough not to reject them in things I did ever pretend to; but what Colour can there be, to admit them in this, where they are no leſs beyond my am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, than out of their proper place? No, Madam, my ſoul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers her ſelf to you in the ſimplicity of her firſt thoughts, and you may eaſily perceive ſhe is not naturally a Rhetorician.

                  <p>COuld I have obtained one moment's diſpenſation from my indiſpoſition, I had told you long ſince that I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humility enough to reject the praiſes you beſtow on me, nor preſumption to aſſent to them. To believe them with an Hiſtoricall faith requires a very ſtrong Imagination; and yet to be offended at ſo obliging a Fable would ſpeak an ill nature. The mean herein which I intend to chooſe ſhall not be to your diſadvantage. I will conſider your excellent language as pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yours, and not with any reference to my ſelf. Thus they ſhall ſtill have their true effect, and I ſhall ever be convinced by them; that is, Madam, of the beauties and perfections of your ſoul; of the Eloquence that gives thoſe praiſes, not that to which they are directed. Pardon my diſtruſtfull humour, I cannot believe you are of the ſame opinion with your Letter, nor that my Relation to <hi>Menander</hi> is of that ſtrength you ſpeak of. Poſſibly it may move you becauſe you are compaſſionate of other mens misfortunes, and your goodneſs intereſſes you in all the adventures of innocence. In this reſpect, indeed, I may deſerve your favour, and your worthy brother too might juſtly take me for one of thoſe objects that need his aſſiſtance. He can defend with as much valour as aſſault, and his bucklers are no leſſe impenetrable, then his other armes are piercing. The piece of his which you ſent me, me thinks, retaines that fatall ſolidity. The greateſt enemyes of ſhewes and Wit-feaſts, will not hereafter be able to violate them, under ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. <hi>Pleaſure</hi> ſhall by his meanes acquire a good repute, and by h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It ſhall ſuffice me, therefore, to tell you without any dreſſe of words, that I am not voide of gratitude for ſo compleat an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation: and that it being impoſſible the preſent I received ſhould be richer, Monſieur <hi>de Scudery</hi> has found out an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170361:111"/> to make it more acceptable, by entruſting you to ſend it. With his permiſſion, I thank you with all my heart, and will ever be, if you pleaſe to ſuffer me,</p>

He proteſts, thoſe houres he paſt with you, are the beſt part of that age he is now drawing to a period of. Your adopted mother values her fruitfullneſs at a lower rate then her fortune, and does ſo often mention her ſonne at Court, that ſhe begins to raiſe jealouſie in him of the Country; for the widdow, that holds up ſo ſtoutly againſt Time, and whom you thought not over-wrinckled, ſhe does with much contentation remember the pleaſant rapture you delivered your ſervice in. It is true, ſhe did not accept it, but yet ſhe dares not deny, that in the very minute ſhe gave you audience, there came into her mind a thought much leſſe ſevere then ſhe uſually harbours, and what ever ſhe ſayes,

I ſhould reape all the advantages, and you would bear all the charge; for a little docileneſſe and good diſpoſition which I might poſſibly contribute to it, you would lay in common a perfect vertue, which is now your own propriety: For this is it I mean when I call you my perfect friend. And ſpeaking of friend, pardon the repetition of what I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly expreſſ'd, I do not mean a Companion for Commerce or good-fellowſhip, nor a perpetuall admirer, nor one that punct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually payes viſits the next morning after he has received them, nor yet one that can write three anſwers to a ſingle Letter. I mean a witneſs to the conſcience, a Phyſitian of ſecret griefes, a governour in proſperity, a comforter in decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fortunes. You are all theſe and ſomthing more: but the miſerie is, Reverend Father, you being at ſo great a diſtance from me deprives me both of the more and the leſs: it debars me the practice of all the good you have done me. I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps think, when I ſet forth from hence, to meet you perhaps

                  <p>I Am affected by you, without having the honour of being known to be ſo. I had no deſignes of requeſting any favour from you, and you have taken pleaſure to oblige me. I but now underſtand how much I am bound to you, and you forbid me to teſtifie my acknowledgements. This is not, Sir, the manner of common goodneſs, and I confeſs the rarity of it, ha's ſurprized me. I Queſtioned at firſt whether this action were done at <hi>Paris</hi> or in the fortunate Iſlands; the corruption, of the yeare one thouſand ſix hundred forty four, or the purity of the Golden Age. However it be, I muſt not permit you ſo

It ſeems you would be ſo highly generous as to make me appeare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, or as if you had a deſign to purchaſe glory with the loſs of my reputation. This is indeed, too much, and your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity muſt be meaſured by charity and moderation. Accuſtome your ſelf to magnanimous actions as much as you pleaſe; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a ſublime and difficult vertue; but leave me at leaſt the eaſieſt and ordinary duties; the laſt and meaneſt member of that ſociety wherein you have thought me fit to be enrolled; I mean, Sir, that of receiving and oweing thankfully, that which binds the poor as well as the rich, and whereof I conceive my ſelf able to diſcharge my ſelf, ſince the heart is ſufficient to do it. I have one yet good enough to be capable of ſuch a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall reſentment: and if I cannot by my merits warrant the teſtimony you have given of me to his Eminence; yet I hope by my paſſion and reſpects, to maintain the happineſs I enjoy in your favour, reſolving to be perfectly as long as I live,</p>

                  <p>I Will neither violate my oath by writing Letters, nor injure our friendſhip by returning you no anſwer. Therefore, if you pleaſe receive this in the Quality of a Ticket, and ſo I ſhall acquit my ſelf of what I owe you, without prejudice to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obligation. What can I ſay to that excellent preſent which you have ſent me? Your Muſes have alwayes ſome new favours for me, and your Poems are the daily recreations of my mind. But you over-valew the teſtimony I have given of them, which expreſſes my intention as imperfectly, as it does their merit. Believe it, were I the <hi>Apollo</hi> of the Poets, and were to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their Chaplets, you ſhould not receive one of the fainteſt verdure, or made with the leaſt care. For the Collection you ſpeak of, notwithſtanding all the paines I took, I cannot eaſily give you ſatisfaction in it. Since our <hi>Scevolaes</hi> dyed, our <hi>Abels</hi> have been almoſt ever ſick: and if there can be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who can purge the Municipall Oratours and Poets of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170361:114"/> their old and ſcurvy ſignification (as I know one that can) who is ſo grave and ſerious, that he would hardly be brought to let his mind ſtoop ſo low as matters of joy; your Collection may then me made without us, or to uſe the phraſe of your Letter, your body may rove up and down the Country freely, there is none to oppoſe you. But I beſeech you, do not complaine of the ſmallneſs of it; the biggeſt are uſually the worſt and we have lately ſeen that a whole Army of Banditti were not worth one Company of a Low-Country Regiment. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further; I ſhall fall unawares into the inconvenience which I counſell you to avoid; at leaſt, this Billet would be a Giant amongſt others of that name, and might hazard to be reckoned in the number of Letters. That muſt be carefully declined, and therefore to take away all likeneſs and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, I ſhall chuſe not to end with <hi>Sir, and your moſt humble ſervant,</hi> though there are not many gentlemen whom I eſteem more then you, nor any perſon more your ſervant then my ſelf,</p>

                  <p>THe lovelieſt ſolitudes are thoſe about <hi>Paris,</hi> and you have the happineſs to be a Courtier in the morning and a Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite after dinner. This is the way not to be tired with either kind of life, and prevent nauſeating by change: for my part, I am here confined to one of the futhermoſt corners of the earth, eight long dayes journeyes diſtant from your polite world, and ſo conſequently reduced to gather a ſimple ſatisfaction with my ſelf, which I can almoſt never do; or if at any time it is only by converſation with the dead, who yet do but repeat me over the ſame things. The condition of Madam <hi>Deſloges</hi> is little better then mine, and unleſſe it be in her own Cloſet or her family, ſhe ſees nothing that can pleaſe her. But ſhe is more to be commiſerated now then any of the yeares paſt. Beſides the melancholineſs of <hi>Limoſin</hi> ſhe apprehends all the dangers of <hi>Breda,</hi> and according to her account it is on her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the Spaniards make all their ſallies, and ſhoot into the trenches of the Hollanders. I lately left her in a fit of theſe fits of diſcontent that made her tremble at the opening of every
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170361:115"/> Letter ſhe received, for feare ſhe ſhould find a ſonne or a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew dead in it. Yet in this deplorable eſtate, ſhe remembred you with comfort, and you were the ſubject of one of our lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt conferences. You were read over and over a dozen times. I ſhewed her the deſcription of your retreate; and ſhe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me with the ſight of other fine things of your making; and this was our reſult for you, that there is good ſenſe in <hi>Paris</hi> as well as at <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and that it is poſſible to invent happily and expreſſe thoſe fancies with ſucceſſe, without the help of Greek or Latine. If I uſe both of them more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, I do not think this forraine abundance any great credit to me; but rather a reproach of my own ſterility. It is, in effect, becauſe I am forced to borrow from others, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted what was my own; and wanting ſtrength, I have need to leane on ſomething to ſupport me. However it be, it is no ſmall matter to pleaſe you, whether as an Originall or a Copy; and ſince you aſſure me that my writings are your moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing divertiſements, I fully reſolve to be a Scribe ſtill, though there were no other Reader in the world but your ſelf.

Your goodneſs has made you one of that number, and to juſtifie this you may pleaſe but to conſult your own memory. Do you remember the day when I made over my affection to you by a ſolemne act? it was in the preſence of the God of the <hi>Seine,</hi> and the Sunne of the meadowes <hi>aux Cleres</hi> was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to it: you aſſured me you were contented with that forme of gift, and that you would not deſire I ſhould ſend you any new titles to it by the Carrier or the Poſt. This is the reaſon of my long and obſtinate ſilence, you may terme it lazineſs as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170361:115"/> long as you pleaſe, but you will injure me if you give it any worſe name; you would derogate from my friendſhip, if you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that it is encloſed in my Letters, and you miſtake one thing for another, if you lay inconſtancy to the charge of a man that is ſtedfaſt even to obſtinacy. I love and eſteem you, do not queſtion it; and had I as much good fortune as good wiſhes you ſhould ſee I am as zealous in eſſentialls, as I am cold in ceremonies. For the two Liſts you ſpeak of, your abſent friend is authour of both one and the other, and conſequently, the complaint you make to him upon occaſion of them is more gallant then reaſonable. I had no hand in the diſtribution of the Copies; and I believe Monſieur <hi>de Campaignole,</hi> who was the chiefe manager of that little affaire, did not think of all my friends.

                  <p>I Am glad you are ſo happily deceived, and that the defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into your eyes hath not done you ſo much miſchief as it threatned. You were afraid of an eternall night, and it has been but an Eclipſe of four and twenty hours; You had bid adieu for ever to that light which was next day to returne to you though <hi>Homer</hi> heretofore was blind, and <hi>Cupid</hi> be ſo ſtill, yet it is not neceſſary you ſhould reſemble them in this, for without loſs of your goodly Eyes you can make goodly verſes, and ſtrike love into either ſexe. I am one of thoſe, I proteſt, whom you have wounded deepeſt, and you ſet me in a fire from the very firſt minute of our converſation. The World is full of falſe Friends. Towns, and Common-Wealths are made up of theſe honeſt kind of Cheaters, and into what place ſoever your Geography can lead me, I am ſure I ſhall not find what
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170361:117"/> you have brought me hither; I mean affection without inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, a fidelity without ſtain, with all the goodneſs and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Golden Age. And, to repreſent me a more lively picture of that happy Age, inſtead of Rivers of milke and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whereof your Anceſtors talked, you have taken a courſe to ſend me mountains of Sugar, and Sweet-meats, and to feed me with Viands which I valew little leſs then Ambroſia. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I am ſomething fearfull of the carriage of them, by reaſon of their delicacie, and the rough hands of the Carrier's ſervant who never heard any one ſpeak of the Golden Age, nor its delicacies. But were they all ſpoyled by the way, I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready extreamly obliged to you for your liberal intention. To remember me before you came to <hi>Orleans,</hi> and in a place where you had ſo agreeable occaſions of diſtraction, was to have plac'd me in your ſoul among the choiſeſt objects of your thoughts, and given me timely notice that I am unworthy and ungratefull, if I am not all my life,</p>

                  <p>I Had need only of two earthen baſons, and I have received a whole Cloſet of rarities. I deſired but enough to ſupply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and ſimplicity, and you have added Ornament and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity. This profuſion is not to be allowed in a man that every day preaches againſt luxury: They are exorbitances which would deſerve reformation in any Common-Wealth more ſevere then ours. I ſpeak this without any manner of aggravation, for you know I have utterly renounced Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes. Neither the Buckler of <hi>ACHILLES</hi> deſcribed by <hi>HOMER,</hi> nor the other rich deſcriptions of the reſt of the great Poets, neither the <hi>Theſis</hi> which the Father <hi>D'orleans</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly dedicated to Monſieur the Cardinal <hi>de la <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>allette,</hi> not all that ever I ſaw of greateſt variety and Hiſtory in the world, is ſo much as what you have done me the favour to ſend me.

You who know <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls clay <hi>Sororem nobis materiam,</hi> and that Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours are moulded out of it: It is not only in Veſſels of the like ſtuff, as you write to my Niece, that Antiquity offered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to their gods; but the gods themſelves were made of it, and you remember that verſe which ſayes,

                  <p>MY admiration is not within your juriſdiction, give me leave to ſpeak of an extraordinary merit in termes that are not common, and allow as much confidence to truth as to flattery. Having ſeen ſuch a multitude of your excellent works, ſo many goodly and choiſe things, I muſt needs ſay there is nothing ſo vaſt, and bound-leſſe as your learning. I except neither the extent of the Ocean, nor the depth of the Abyſſe. I will maintaine, that your ſoul is of another kind then ours, and you know more then can be comprehended by a humane capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. They that think it ſufficient to call you a <hi>Genius,</hi> do not expreſſe you in your full latitude: They omit ſome thing that is eſſentiall, and forget two words that ſhould attend the firſt. You are indeed, a gentle and amiable <hi>Genius:</hi> one of that charitable order that love and help men; and have as much goodneſſe as knowledge. You poſſeſſe the vertues of urbanity in the ſame degree of perfection as you do the advantages of wit, whereof I have an eminent inſtance in my hands; and I perceive Sir, by the Letter ſo extreamly modeſt, civill and obliging which you have favour'd me with, that the French gentleneſſe and courteſie ha's retired with you to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the North, into the Country and among the Sons of <hi>Neptune.</hi> You are in all regards the grand enemy of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme, and alwayes the abſolute favourite of thoſe Goddeſſes, called <hi>Manſuetiores,</hi> even to the excluding the graces and <hi>

The inclination that moves you to do good to all, is nevertheleſs fatall to ſome; you ſometimes wage warre; and if neceſſity require it, you do it to the extremity with all the forces of reaſon and all the Artillery of Authority. Woe be to counterfeit Learning, and Errour puffe up with preſumption when they dare make head againſt you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As you protect the weake, ſo you chaſtiſe the Tyrants: and it muſt be acknowledged that unleſſe you had come in to our aſſiſtance, there would in a ſhort time have been no liberty in a State that ha's been hitherto eſteemed Ariſtocraticall and —.

                  <p>ALI things will be at the beſt paſſe in the world, provided you be well, and that the defluxion your Letter tells me of, be not obſtinate in tormenting you.

I beſeech God render every one according to his works! at leaſt that he do not deal with Temperance more ſeverely then with Exceſſe, and that your deſignes be no longer interrupted by the ſurprizes of this vexatious diſeaſe, which ſometimes oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the reſolutions of the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> May you give light and ornament to the world for many periods of the Suns moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Be not weary in doing good to mankind, and enriching our Age with the treaſures of your wit, inſtructing them that are now alive, with them that are yet unborn. You will without queſtion find equity and gratitude, both in this and future Ages. Rationall Learned men, who invoke you in the difficult tracts of Antiquity, and in the Quickſands and Rocks of Hiſtory, will not refuſe you their oblations after they have propitiated you with their prayers. For my part, I owe you more then all the reſt, I ſhall promiſe you as religious an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as any, but I dare not ſay any thing that favours of the profane medley which I have blamed. I will not ſpeak any

                  <p>I Was tranſported with joy at the opening of your Letter, but upon obſervation of the date and that it was written from <hi>Paris,</hi> I was reduc'd to a more calme and ſerene gladneſs. This little Abridgement of your <hi>Odyſſeus</hi> compoſed in a place of ſecurity, reſtored my mind to its former tranquillity, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſ'd my inquietude. For indeed I began to have doubtfull apprehenſions of you, I was at the ſame time afraid of Heaven, Earth, and Sea; that is, of ſickneſſe, impriſonment, and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack. But now the cloud is diſpell'd, and if I were one that committed the faults which I have reproved, or mingled two Religions together, I ſhould pay my vowes to Fortune; I ſhould offer a victime to <hi>Mercury:</hi> and give thanks to the other Gods that preſide over travelling abroad and returning, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a Head that is ſo infinitely deare to me. But we muſt not withhold our acknowledgments from the authour of the mercy. Let us be gratefull to your good Angell, or rather to him that put you in his cuſtody; and confeſſe, that if you had been minded to paſſe through <hi>Hungary</hi> and make a voyage out of the Chriſtian world, he would have tamed the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians for your ſake,

                  <p>But you have done better, not to hazard your ſelf upon ſuch an occaſion, and to be contented with the view of the fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of a Country, wherein you would not have found many Libraryes. I am of opinion, there are but very few Turkes Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricians or Philoſophers: you would hardly have met with any ſolution of your doubts amongſt a people that hold forth ignorance the fundamentall Article of their Religion. They take the moſt vulgar operations of the Mathematicks, for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170361:121"/> and believe Printing, and Clocks, inventions of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell. So that I extreamly approve your ſtay in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the deſire you had to underſtand and obſerve the deportment of the moſt rationall People of the world. But why do not you ſpeak of <hi>Rome</hi> as well as <hi>

And it is poſſible, had you written that Elegy <hi>ad Romam,</hi> which you have written <hi>ad Venetias,</hi> the good Pope that underſtand, the making of verſes might have return'd you an anſwer which is beyond the skill of the Duke —.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170361:122"/> back into former ages, and am ſometimes become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to the <hi>Sulpitii</hi> or <hi>Scevolaes,</hi> and at other times to the <hi>Tertullians</hi> and <hi>Cyprians.</hi> That which you have ſent me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme my opinion of one of thoſe good fathers, is moſt worthy both of you and him. And ſhould he returne from the other world himſelfe to give an account of his thoughts, he could not juſtifie them better. But becauſe they may ſeeme ſomewhat harſh and ſtrange, (at leaſt to the nicety of women and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of children) and appearing in French caſt a generall fright on all unlatin'd people, I could wiſh you had taken the paines to transfuſe them out of the vulgar tongue into the learned, and adde this new benefit to all the old favours which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ha's received from you.

                  <p>YOu entreat me a great benefit to my ſelf when you deſire my company. I underſtand what advantage a man that has but good ears may gain by it, and I ſhould have a ſoul too ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and flinty, if it would not be mollified by the remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces you uſe to me. Though I am one of the moſt rigid Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites that live in the Deſart, I muſt confeſs, you have ſhook the firmneſs of my vow, and the ſociety of one of your merit is a violent temptation to encline me to Apoſtacy. A ſolitary life has indeed its charmes and delights: But who can chuſe but grow lean, when he is brought to that paſs as he has no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment but his own juyce? And how commendable ſoever the commerce with books be, yet every thing conſidered, is it not an unburying of the dead, and oftentimes a deſcending into their Sepulchres by deep and melancholy meditation? A man had almoſt as good work in the mines. He runs the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and hazard, and brings back no better a countenance, nor eyes leſs ſunck in his head. They are living books that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the mind, without prejudice to the ſight, and you are Sir, one of thoſe excellent and agreeable books. What delight then is in ſuch volumes as can anſwer and reply! they ſave the labour of ſcrutiny and choice, by preſenting things pure and ſimple: they have ſomething of more power and life then reading can poſſibly be capable of. And though your three great favourites, <hi>Terence, Horace,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgil,</hi> be my ancient inclinations too, yet I confeſs I never accounted them ſuch hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fellows as when I heard them ſpeak out of your mouth.

                  <p>YOUR Excellent Verſes are ſeducing Spirits that come to tempt Anchorites they had like to have deſtroy'd the merit of many years ſolitude in a moment, and I confeſs I had an inclination to review the world that produces ſuch admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things. But the temptation was not long; according to the uſuall manner, ſecond thoughts were wiſer then the firſt. The conſideration of my honour retain'd me, and I bethought my ſelf it would be dangerous to adminiſter you an occaſion of undeceiving your ſelf, and ſuppoſed it was not the beſt of my prudence to give you a neerer Proſpect of that, which owes all its beauty to diſtance of place, and the paſſion of Monſieur <hi>Menage.</hi> It is more advantagious to me to preſerve the good opinion you have of me by my abſence then to do my ſelf an ill office with you by my preſence. There is no Queſtion but you would ſtill ſeek me after you had found me; and perceiving nothing in my perſon either worthy of my name, or your curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, you would call Fame to an account for her teſtimony of me, and <hi>Monſieur Menage</hi> for his love. Poſſibly I might in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times have had ſomething in me that would not have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed; But heretofore is not now. Age that never comes alone, does oppreſs me with ſo many diſeaſes, that leſſer ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines then I feel would ſerve to cruſh far greater Ornaments then I was ever capable to receive from ſome little Art, and weak Naturals. Time effects ſtrange Metamorphoſes. The Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of this world were the miracles of the paſt: and ſuch a She as has been plac'd amongſt Temples and Altars, and ſhewn for miraculous, has now no other place but a Chimney corner, and hides her ſelf to avoid frighting of people. That Famous Wraſtler that flung all men in the Liſts of Exerciſes is now the poor bed-ridden Paralytick whom all the World
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170361:123"/> commiſerates. I am not yet reduced to ſo deplorable an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: it threatens me, and I am drawing neer it. I want ſtrength and the quickneſſe of my apprehenſion failes me: I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to dye in my memory; and I loſe my ſoul by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Though the Syren of <hi>France</hi> (for ſo you are pleaſed to call me) is not altogether dumbe, yet ſhe is become for the moſt part hoarſe, and Rheumatick and at her beſt ha's ſo ſcurvy a little pipe that ſhe ha's not voice enough to lull aſleep the drowſieſt marriner in your Country. You, Sir, are in the flower of age and in the condition to charme not only <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> companions, but himſelf: I meane, you can equally pleaſe the People, and the Wiſe; beſtow pleaſure on the eare, and give ſatisfaction to the mind. At four and twenty you have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheived whatever an exquiſite education can adde to an happy birth: and that flouriſhing youth is attended by ſo great a number of other gifts from Heaven, that I unleſſe I arm'd my heart with more then a triple plate of braſſe, I could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo many <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enuſſes</hi> and Graces from making impreſſion upon it. Thoſe which I found in the <hi>Hendecaſyllables</hi> I received, would have tickled a ſoul that were the moſt enemy to Verſe and Muſick in the world, and would have tamed the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage beaſt in the deſart. You do me the favour to believe me more humane and reaſonable; and conſequently you cannot doubt the eſteem I have of a preſent which I cannot rate high enough. I will only ſay this little to you, and deliver you my opinion of them. They are ſo ſoft, ſo amourous, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that I believe they would hinder me from feeling the ſtroak of the hardeſt, moſt virulent, and cruell Iambicks, that Monſieur your father could diſcharge againſt me, if I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked his indignation. Do not repent, I beſeech you, that you have made me happy: prolong my good fortune by the continuation of your favour.

                  <p>YOu do injuſtice to your Academick, to ſubmit his book to my cenſure. I adore the myſteries in it, though I cannot
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170361:124"/> comprehend them, and have no mind to uſe the liberty which you have given me. I ſhould render you but a ſlender account of a Science wherein I am but at the Accidence. I ſcarce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand viſible objects, and the outſide of nature: and for what is above it, I dare not attempt to climbe up ſo high. My curioſity is not ſo preſumptuous and I wholly referre my ſelf to the Sorboniſts concerning ſuperiour things; Expect not here, therefore, from me a preciſe judgment of what I cannot reach. I have not diſcover'd the depth of the book: It is true, Madam, the outſide and ſurface is very beautifull and is precious. I am raviſhed with the ſound of the harmony which is made by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I cannot comprehend: this way of writing would have ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the Philoſophers whom it had not convinced. And had Gregory of <hi>Nazianza,</hi> ſhewn ſuch a piece of work to his friend <hi>Themistius,</hi> queſtionleſſe it had wrought upon him He would have admired the appearance and outſide of Chriſtianity though he could not have beheld the ſecret and interiour part of it. They are not words printed and read on the paper, they are felt, &amp; penetrate even to the very heart. They live and have motion; and I perceive ſomething of the vigour of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and the ſtyle of that Heroick age wherein the ſame ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue animated ſpeeches and actions; conveyed it ſelf into the Wit and Courage, and bred Doctours and Martyrs. Will you pleaſe Madam, to tell me the ſincere truth? Ha's not he that appeares in the front of theſe Chapters, been at the Oracle of our Ladyes Cloiſter? Ha's he not been inſpired by our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Abbot? In earneſt, I conceiv'd I had known his ſtyle. I obſerved traces and impreſſions of his wit in ſeverall paſſages and exclaimed with <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                     <q>Theſe are his eyes, his hands, his Countenance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Doctour ought not to be offended at my ſuſpition: I do not injure him in ſaying he ha's the veine of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary perſon. So noble a reſemblance is an infinite advantage to a mediocrity and there is nothing low in imitation of the higheſt Idea that can be aimed at. If my conjectures be well grounded, ſollicite that Grand Artiſt to ſit cloſe to his work, and follow it openly, and let the Oracle ſpeak it ſelf without an interpreter. Beſides your high merit herein, Madam, from the Church, you will have more encouragements to maintaine that underſtanding piety nobly, which the Oracle himſelſe told me was in you. You will have ſomething more to lock up in that rich cabinet wherewith you dazzeled my eyes the other day;

                  <p>IT is true, I affect ſilence better then noiſe, but who ever told you I lov'd it above muſick? Who inform'd you, I preferred my lumpiſh, and ſtupid indolence before your lively and ſubtle pleaſures? As many perſons would do me a pleaſure to leave me to my reſt, ſo you oblige me in diſturbing it. There is no ſlumber ſo ſweet, but is infinitely recompenced by ſo wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a voice as yours. Beſides, what is written at <hi>Paris</hi> and related at Court, may very juſtly awaken the attention of a contemplative dreamer, although he meditated upon the banks of <hi>Seine.</hi> So that you need not queſtion, but I ſhall readily forgoe a calme much more ſerene then mine, and a River that glides much more gently then ours, to regard that uniform ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and orderly torrent which ruſhed from the mouth of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi> The ſtyle and work of your friend preſent me with a certain Reſemblance of it, and I confeſſe I have not often ſeen a thing ſo Impetuous, and yet withall ſo Regular. But Rules are beſt learn'd by Time, and Study gives Art to the leaſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate natures. There is that ſecret force in him which ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates his words and comes immediately from Heaven, and that with grandeur and Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>This perſon ha's Received a very ample portion; and if theſe be Elogies which he diſpenſes in this manner, they ſeem to be utter'd in the ſame tone as if he were making Lawes or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing judgments. He adores indeed, but 'tis with Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and familiarity; whereof one is the companion of a good conſcience, and the other proceeds from love. Such as are not of his opinion may terme him idolater and inamorato, as long as they pleaſe, without moving his paſſion; but they cannot with juſtice accuſe him either of hypocriſie or flattery. He ſpeakes his beliefe; and delivers nothing ſlight and low, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all his conceptions are above mediocrity. Although I
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170361:125"/> am become an implacable enemy to every thing that has the reſemblance of a Paneygrick, yet I am pleaſ'd with this for that very reaſon. His mind being wholly poſſeſſ'd with his ſubject, is not ſo taken up in contrivance of a Harangue, and ſcanning over common places, as to make himſelf intelligible, and repreſent his Ideas. Every thing ſeems naturall and his own; even the ornaments which he borrows; and there is no part in it but is free, yea ſervitude it ſelf triumphs. That ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, I ſay, which cannot but provoke envy, and ſeem glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and noble in the eyes of all. How is it poſſible to hold out againſt ſuch a violent manner of writing, which has a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive power diſguiſed in the Art of perſwading? And do not you ſeem to deſire my approbation, in the ſame faſhion, that one of young <hi>Caeſars</hi> Captains demanded the conſul-ſhip for his Maſter? <hi>This,</hi> ſaid he, laying his hand on his ſword, <hi>This ſhall do it, if you will not.</hi> There is therefore no room for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I Found a ſtrange alteration of eaſe and recovery upon the receite of your Packet, and I cannot contain from proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miracle in the beginning of my Letter. Your <hi>Cinna</hi> reſtores health to the ſick: He cauſes the Paralytick to clap his hands, and gives ſpeech to the Dumb, much more to a Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick. I had indeed loſt my ſpeech with my voice, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repoſſeſſ'd of both, by the vertue of what you ſent me, it is juſt that I employ them to your glory, and publiſhing the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verainty of the remedy. Yet you fear you are one of thoſe, that are over charged with the Majeſty of the ſubjects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they treat, and you are not ſatisfi'd that you have brought ſtrength enough for the ſupport of the <hi>Roman Grandeur.</hi> This modeſty does more pleaſe then perſwade me, and I am bound to oppoſe it on the behalfe of truth. You are too nice an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer of a compoſition that has been called excellent by the publick voyce; and though it were true, that you had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd a little diſparity of weakneſs in ſome part of it, yet this ought to be a ſecret between your Muſes and your ſelf, ſince I am confident it would be for ever imperceptible by any other. The weakneſs ſhould be rather charged on our expreſſion and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170361:126"/> the incapacity of our language, then your conceit, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect imputed to the inconcinnity of the inſtruments, not to want of skill in the Artiſt. You have ſhewn us as much of <hi>Rome</hi> as is poſſible to be ſeen at <hi>Paris</hi> without any prejudice by the removall. It is not a <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Caſſiodorus,</hi> forlorne and —as it was in the age of the <hi>Theodorus.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> and as magnificent and pompous as it was in the time of the firſt <hi>Caeſars.</hi> You have even found that which ſhe had loſt in the ruines of the Common-wealth, her noble and magnanimous fierceneſs. We meet with ſome tolerable tranſlators of her language and expreſſions, but you are the true and faithfull Interpreter of her ſpirit and courage. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed yet higher, Sir, and tell you, that I know you are many times her Tutour, and admoniſh her of decorum when ſhe has forgotten it. You are the reformer of Antiquity, where it wants either Ornament or ſupport. In thoſe places where <hi>Rome</hi> was but of brick, you rebuild her with Marble; wherever you find a void interſtice, you fill it up with a Maſter-piece; and I have obſerv'd that what you ſupply to the Hiſtory, of your own, is ever tranſcendent to that which you borrow from it. The wife of <hi>Horatius</hi> and the Miſtreſs of <hi>Cinna,</hi> which are two daughters of yours and purely creatures of your brain, what are they leſs then the principall Ornaments of your two Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems? Is there any thing of the production of good antiquity in the weaker ſexe, that is comparably vigorous and ſtrong to theſe late <hi>Heroeſſes,</hi> which you have brought into the World; to theſe Roman Dames of your begetting? After a fornights time, I am not ſatisfied with ſurveying the perfections of her that came hither laſt. I have aſtoniſh'd all the Wits of our Province with the ſight of her. Our Oratours and our Poets ſpeak wonders of her. But a Doctour of my Neighbourhood, who is ordinarily upon the high ſtrain, ſpeaks of her indeed after a ſtrange manner. The firſt day he was contented to ſay that your <hi>Aemilia</hi> was the Rival of <hi>Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> in their zeal of Liberty, But now he goes far higher. Sometimes he ſwears ſhe is poſſeſſ'd with the Genius of the Common-wealth, and at other times calls her the faire, reaſonable, holy, and adorable Fury. Theſe are ſtrange words indeed, concerning your Roman Virago, but yet they are not deſtitute of reaſon, and foundation. She do's in effect inſpire the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, and diffuſes heat to the party by the Fire which ſhe
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170361:126"/> raiſes in the breaſt of their Generall. She endeavours to intereſt all the World in her revenge? and would make a ſacrifice to her Father, which were too great for <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf. She is in my opinion a perſon ſo excellent, that I think I ſpeak not too much to her advantage, when I ſay that you are more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in your iſſue then <hi>Pompey</hi> was in his, and that your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Aemilia,</hi> is without compariſon of greater worth then his Grand-Child <hi>Cinna.</hi> If he had more vertue then <hi>Seneca</hi> could imagine, it is becauſe he fell into your hands and had the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of your care. He is oblig'd to You for his merit, as to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> for his dignity. The Emperour made him Conſul and you have rendred him an honeſt man. This you have effected by the Rules of an Art that adornes and refines truth; that allows favour in imitation, and that ſometimes propoſes to it ſelf the apparent and ſometimes the true good. I ſhall ſay too much if I adde any more. I will not begin a Diſſertation but end a Letter, and conclude with the uſuall proteſtations but moſt ſincere and true, that I am,</p>

                  <p>YOu write me ſtrange news concerning the Doctour that is fallen into diſgrace for having ſpoken too liberally of Grace. Certainly your Theologues are men of no ordinary temper, ſince they ſpeak of the affaires of heaven as if they were Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours of ſtate in that Kingdome, and declare the ſecrets of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as freely, as if they were his Confidents.</p>
                  <p>They conceive their news as certain, and deliver it as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively, as if they had not only ſlept in his boſome with St. <hi>JOHN.</hi> But even as if they had watch't in his heart and ſoul, and there were none of his intentions hid from their knowledges. Do you not think there is laughing enough at their brawls and conteſts; and that the Church Triumphant is offended at them. For my part, I conceive the modeſty and diſcretion of our ignorance would be more pleaſing to God then the preſumption and inſolence of our Doctrine; and that he better approves of a peaceable ſilence, and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170361:127"/> then of a warre of bitter words in which it is very difficult to ſave our charity. You remember that Ode of <hi>Ronſard,</hi> which <hi>Galandius</hi> once eſteem'd worth the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of which is,
<q>

                  <p>A perſon, which you know, tells me, that unleſſe Monſieur the Coadjutour redouble his prohibitions, it is to be fear'd there will be ſtore of theſe <hi>Errants,</hi> and that <hi>Grace</hi> will make Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams of more then one of theſe ſubtill diſputers, who examine the queſtion with too much curioſity. I approve your not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your ſelf on either part, and the Neutrality which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to hold to, notwithſtanding, the perſon you know, cryes as farre as he can ſee you, that <hi>media via nulla via est, quae ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que amicos parit neque inimicos tollit.</hi> But yet I muſt tell you, that this Neutrality which I conſent to, muſt not be altogether dumbe, and that I conſent not to it, ſaving upon condition, that you give an account of it to the Publick, and juſtifie it by a large and eloquent Manifeſto. The Cavalier, which your Letter mentions thought to have been the bearer of mine, and to have had time enough, to keep his Court with you at <hi>Paris</hi> before the beginning of the Campagne. But here arriv'd a Meſſenger to tell him that his Brigade was commanded to — and ſo he is neceſſitated to depart hence directly thither. He would have been glad to have entertain'd you with ſome newes of me, and not unwilling to have ſeen the faire St. <hi>Germans.</hi> Nevertheleſſe in this laſt unhappineſſe, his comfort is that he goes to ſerve under a Prince, that performes things of greater admiration and excellency, &amp;c. — I am,</p>

                  <p>THe book which you have ſent me from Monſieur <hi>Scarron,</hi> is a preſent very acceptable to me, and which I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prize at no meane rate. At the firſt peruſall it ſerved me for Phyſick and reliev'd me from a fit of the ſpleen, which had quite overcome me, if that had not come timely to my ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170361:127"/> I hope it will effect much more upon frequent applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Poſſibly it may cure me of my ſeriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> penſiveneſſe and my melancholy Philoſophy; and I ſhall learne to turne Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery Bills and Proceſſes into rime, and become buxome by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion. He is indeed an admirable Infirme. He enjoyes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is better then health, I meane dull and materiall health, for you know the <hi>Arabians</hi> deſcribe joy to be the flower and ſpirit of a quick and active health. Since you are deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to know the ſeverall thoughts which I have had of this infirme, and require a particular Chapter of them, I tell you, Sir, that he is a man either the g eateſt diſſembler, or moſt patient and conſtant in the world. I look upon him as one that beares witneſſe againſt the tenderneſs of mankind, or elſe paine treats him with more courteſie then ſhe does other mortalls: It may ſeem the Tormentour ha's conſpir'd to flatter the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. When I ſee him laugh in the middle of his paines and tortures, I cannot but think the diſeaſe do's rather tickle then pierce and pinch him. In a word, I affirme, that the <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> the <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the <hi>Philoctetes</hi> of Poetry, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Job</hi> of Truth, did utter high expreſſions in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their torments, but never jocund and pleaſant. And that in ſeverall places of Antiquity I have met with conſtant, modeſt, yea and wiſe griefes too, but never any that were mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and blithe but this; nor was there ever before heard of a ſoul that could dance the Saraband and the Matachines in a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyticall body. Such an eminent prodigy deſerves the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of inquiſitive Philoſophers. Hiſtory muſt not forget it, and if I had a fancy to be an Hiſtorian, as I am an Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, I would record it for none of the leaſt miracles of our times, which have not been unfruitfull in the production of great ones. 'Tis not my deſigne to diminiſh the glory of the dead, with whom I have had ſome friendſhip too. But there are different degrees of glory; and though the quality of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle be a Title not a little conſiderable in a Chriſtian family, yet it muſt be acknowledged, that the Marty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dome of the Son has ſomewhat more rare in it then the Apoſtleſhip of the father. What thoughts would your <hi>Seneca</hi> have had concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, who ſometimes took ſo much pleaſure in treating of the like ſubjects, and ſo often ſought occaſions to do it. Is it not true, that that rough and haughty vertue, which he ha's ſo much commended, &amp; which vaunted it could be at eaſe in the Bull of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> and ſay all was well, was, but the bare ſhadow
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170361:128"/> of this vertue, ſo ſweet and humble, that can put in practice the Paradoxes of the other, and yet boaſt of nothing at all. Let us conclude therefore in honour of <hi>the Queen's infirme</hi> that there is either Extaſie or Poſſeſſion in his Malady, and that the ſoul do's her affaires apart, without being concern'd in the matter. Or elſe that he ha's an extraordinary courage and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and that the ſoul wraſtles with the body with all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages the greateſt ſtrength can have over the greateſt debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

Since your vertue is ſo delicate as not to endure the perfumes and flowers which it merits, it is neceſſary to comply with the ſtrangeneſſe of your humour, and you muſt be obeyd though it be with injuſtice. So that you ſhall neither receive incenſe or Chaplets from my hand; notwithſtanding I cannot paſſe it,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170361:129"/> without proteſting againſt the violence which you do me. I will complaine of the loſſe of my liberty, and informe the world, that 'tis no fault of mine that I am not juſt. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſo, Sir, as farre as the will and endeavours. Your juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction do's not extend to the ſecrets of my heart, and you cannot hinder the devotion of my ſoul, although you do with ſo much ſeverity prohibite me the ceremonies and outward worſhip. I queſtion not but you will find my expreſſions very high, when you are the ſubject, which yet do not ſeem ſuch to me. My words, I conceive, may be drawn from holy things without offending Religion; and your verſes being related to it, I look on it as a piece of divine ſervice to read them. Since the Muſes which ſupply you with ſuch excellent inventions are not falſe Deities, the honour which is given them goes directly to Heaven; and we adore the inſpirer of Prophets and Sybills, when we admire a Poet ſo chaſt and pure as you. Be pleaſ'd to admit this truth, which is compatible with their modeſty, and repreſents you ſome ſhadow of my intention. If you would allow me to diſplay it, what ſhould I not ſay of the early at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements which I have ſeen, and of that prudent and grave youth, which reproaches my gray haires? But the orders which I have receiv'd from you are of too ſtrict a tenour, and you will be ſo punctually obey'd, that I cannot ſo much as publiſh your Elogium in Epitome. All I can do in a perſon ſo commendable, and that is offended with the effects of his vertue, is, to eſteem him perfectly in my heart, and to be, as I am with all my ſoul,</p>

I will content my ſelf to read them ſo often, as to be able to give you account of every verſe; and to tell you, that this tickled me with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and the acuteneſs of that touch'd me to the quick, I was wholly tranſported by another, and ſuch a whole ſcene charm'd me.

                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>

                  <p>I Have heard you would not permit the publication of a book, newly made againſt me, though the harme I had thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived had been ſmall. My obligements to you for the favour cannot but be great; it being a very particular care you have for the quiet of my life, not to ſuffer the leaſt noiſe to diſturbe it. I know not, my Lord, whether you may not ſeem to have treated with too much delicacy, one who makes profeſſion of Philoſophy. It is enough the publique authority ſhelters me from the tempeſt without defending me from the wind and duſt; and that it protects my hermitage from the violence of ſalvage beaſts without beating off the flyes, and other impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Inſects from me. But, my Lord, the goodneſs you have for me goes beyond the limits of ordinary juſtice: you would not only I ſhould enjoy a calme repoſe, amidſt the agitations of all <hi>Europe,</hi> but were farther willing the world ſhould have ſome reſpect for my retiredneſs, and that being eloigned from
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170361:131"/> the ſociety of men I ſhould be placed without the reach of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. And yet it purſued St. <hi>Jerome</hi> even to the Grott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Bethelem, and to the foot of our Saviours cradle, it even there found him out, though, as himſelf tells us, he endeavour'd to lye hid; if that inſolent had no conſideration for ſo admirable a ſanctity, nor for a place guarded by Angells, no wonder a vulgar innocence, retired into a village ill fortified, ſhould not find a very favourable entertainment. But to paſſe from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of manners to the high qualities and endowments of the ſoul, if from time to time there have been bold revolts againſt the heads of Arts and diſciplines, and if within the memory of our fathers, it hath publiquely been ſaid at <hi>Paris,</hi> that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was a bad Sophiſter, I think my ſelf civilly uſed in that place that they content themſelves to call me a bad writer, that grand Blaſphemer of the name of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as well by his penne as by his tongue, was (as you know) Peter <hi>Ramus,</hi> who though of our Religion, paſſ'd for an Hugue not in the Maſſacre, and dyed the death of the Rebells and the Factious: in effect ſome have thought, God permitted it by a juſt judgment and that the tutela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y Angell of Learning took the colour of the cauſe of faith to revenge the injury by him done to reaſon. There is this day living in <hi>Germany</hi> a tyrant Grammarian, an enemy of univerſall truths, an accuſer of <hi>Cicero,</hi> who not long ſince hath printed his Animadverſions, wherein he is ſo impudent as to arraigne his judge, and to diſpute the praecedence of the Prince of Latine Antiquity: inſomuch, My Lord, that the conſent of all Mankind, confirmed by a poſſeſſion of eighteen ages, is not Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſound enough to ſecure the reputation of that Roman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pedantry of this Barbarian. If then it availes not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that ſhe hath been conſecrated by time, and crowned by the people to preſerve her inviolate from the attempts of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons there is no ſhew of likelihood, I ſhould move their compaſſion, amongſt ſo many injured Hero's, or that I ſhould have reſpect ſhowne me, when <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> are not in ſafety. An ordinary man ought not in juſtice to complaine, if he undergoeth the ſame deſtiny with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary perſons, neither would it be handſome in me to petition, you would reforme the world for my only intereſt. I know not, My Lord, but that this petty diſorder may be of ſome uſe to the Common wealth; and it were to be wiſh'd that malice would alwayes amuſe it ſelf in things of ſo ſmall concerne, to the end it might never intermeddle with affaires of greater moment.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170361:131"/> Thoſe who have employed their talent, in perverting the ſenſe of my words, and falſifying my works, had otherwiſe perhaps been buſied in forging wills, and coyning money. And he who now only deſires an Imprimatur from you for his book, had I not been, might have ſued to you for a Reprieve, or Act of grace. 'Tis much better, injuſtice ſhould ſpert it ſelf with my books, then that it ſhould have ought to do in civill ſociety; 'tis much the leſſer inconvenience, that injurious perſons ſhould tranſpoſe words, and alter periods, then that they ſhould remove the Land-marks, and ruinate the houſes of their Neighbours, it is, to ſay the truth, the moſt innocent imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vice can have; and I do not think the Common-wealth a little beholden to me, that I have for theſe ten yeares ſet a-work a number of retchleſſe idle fellowes who apparantly would have proved dangerous Citizens, if they had not choſen to be ridiculous Cenſurers: 'tis very well if the heat of their ſouls exhales this way; if their intemperance finds this vent; and that, to avoid their rage, their folly may be licenſed, leave them then (my Lord) this exerciſe; they know not what to do with their time, and will employ it worſe if you will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to uſe it thus: ſuffer their turbulent youth to ſpend its fury upon an inſenſible ſubject, and to combat dead words which are neither capable of griefe nor joy, ſo long as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves before you in no other quality then as Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Penne, be not ſparing of the Kings grace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſomewhat of your ſeverity. If the thing were new to me, 'tis likely I ſhould not find my ſelf aggrieved that the firſt Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet that libell'd me ſhould be ſtopt in the preſſe, but now that there is already a faire Library of them got together, I am well content they ſhould encreaſe and multiply and take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to behold a goodly heap of ſtones which envy hath thrown without hurting me. The reproach of ſome perſons is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by me as ſhamefull, becauſe I eſteem not their praiſe for honeſt. I do not trouble my ſelf to go begging of voices or making Cabals, that I may be approved by all ſorts of people. I have what I deſire (my Lord) if I have your approbation; as that which proceeds from an un-erring principle, &amp; an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding perfectly cleare. God had indued you with a ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne judgment before the King had bequeathed his ſoveraigne juſtice into your hands, and you were all po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170361:132"/> enemy, and am more proud to have pleaſed you, then I ſhould be ſatisfied ſhould you have preſcribed all my adverſaries the advantagious diſcourſes you have held with me upon diverſe occaſions, your Picture which you were pleaſed to give me laſt yeare as the gage of your affection, thoſe rich works of yours which you have formerly made me partaker of, I meane thoſe writings animated with the ſoul of State and full of the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of your Maſter, which appear'd to me ſo tranſcendently above the force of the preſent age, and ſo worthy the Romane Majeſty; in a word (my Lord) every moment of that happy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon I had the honour to paſſe with you in your Cabinet, are Priviledges for which I have dearer conſiderations, then for what you have denied to the Ape or Fantaſme of Philar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus. I dare not mention what other obligements I have to you: in that particular you have injoyned me ſilence, with a beliefe your favours would go leſſe, and receive alloy in their purity, ſhould my acknowledgments waite upon them; 'tis not fit however, you ſhould oblige me from having the intentions of an honeſt man, nor deprive me the liberty of gratefull thoughts.

Tell him moreover that this Father underſtood neither Greek nor Latin; but the late King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great had a good eſteem of his French, his capacity and honeſty. He even deſir'd to have him neere him, and had he not been ty'd by affection to the ſervice of a meaner Maſter, whom he would not quit for a greater, it is poſſible your friend might have been ſon to a Secretary of State.</p>

But withall it is most true, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire particularly to live that I may enjoy the content in my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame old age, to ſee, before I leave the world, thoſe faire works of yours publiſh'd, which I have already view'd in writing. It ſeemes to we (Deare Sonne) that you cannot reaſonably deny me this laſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction I demand from you, and that, ſhould you farther harden your ſelfe in your deniall of my requeſt, your Excuſes would ſavour more of Melancholy then Modeſty.

I know well, you are abundantly rich in things of rarity and value; but to keep them cloſe priſoners in your Cabinet, is to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous: and I deſire you with as much affection as is due to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your nature, which never yet refuſ'd me obedience, not to let me continue longer in a languiſhing ſuſpence: content the impatience of

And in the firſt place (Deare Sonne) ſend to the preſſe with what convenient ſpeed you can, the two books of your Apology; which in my judgment are admirable, and which I have read, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed many times, and alwayes with a new pleaſure. You owe this not onely to the glory of the publique and your own reputation, but alſo to the honour of our family, and to my particular intereſt; to the end you may diſabuſe certaine people who were induced to believe, upon the credit of a falſe witneſſe, that you have not alwayes had an high esteem for me, nay more that you were unwilling to allow me a place amongſt reaſonable creatures. Thus was it fooliſhly concluded by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous ſubtilty of the Doctour, who deſign'd to ſet us at variance, but that is beyond the power of School-niceties and diſtinctions to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and there is no piece of Sophistry whatſoever can induce me to think ill of you to the prejudice of a multitude of good offices, my old age hath received, and daily doth receive from your aſſiſtance: for which I beg of the Almighty alwayes to preſerve you in his favour.

It is a Hiſtory which I ſhal recount to you in perſon. I think Heaven ordain'd the occaſion of it ſome years ſince, to the end I ſhould not dye with ſorrow at preſent.

The freedome whereof I make profeſſion will not permit me to play the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler with you, and I have diſcharged that into your boſome, which lay ſo heavy upon my heart.

So that I ſhot a hundred and fifty leagues beyond the mark, and perceive that he that cauſ'd me to write

He impoſ'd upon me with a fable to draw a Letter from me, upon which I think he will neither find credit at the Bank nor Courteſie among the Croates, if he ſhould fall into their hands. But I am ſorry I have cauſe to complaine of a man of your country, and am conſtrain'd to aske, <hi>What is become of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man candour and ſinceritie?</hi> I beſeech you let not this word ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliſe you, for at the ſame moment I anſwer my ſelf, that it is retired into your breaſt. And though War ſhould have waſted all; though it ſhould ſuffer neither Vertue nor Civility upon the face of the Earth, yet I am aſſured you would not ceaſe to be good in the generall ruine of good manners. You can love and oblige your friends with tokens of ſo ardent and paſſionate a remembrance, that I ſhould be more cold and flinty then the rocks of deſart, if I did not kindle at your fire, and feel the points of your words. I wiſh to God, Sir, I were neerer to you to make a greater benefit of my fortune and draw more profit from ſo advantagious a neighbourhood. You have made a book <hi>de Sestortiis;</hi> but I ſhould then begin to reckon by Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, I ſhould flow in abundance on all hands, and beſide the naturall riches of your wit, you would entertaine me with the Treaſures of Antiquity.

I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Paris</hi> to cauſe another diſcourſe to be ſent you, in which I conceive I have pleaded the cauſe of the people, with all the reſpect that is due to the Majeſty of Soveraignes.

                  <p>I Am devoted to your glory, that it does not trouble me to be poore, provided you have wherewith to exerciſe your libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Monſieur <hi>Chaplain</hi> gives me notice of half a ſhop that you are ſending to me, and that there is need of a wagon for the conveyance. Certainly it will be enough to make me a great Doctour, if I be not wanting in capacity. I hope to make ſome profit of the long communication, that I ſhall have by your favour with Monſieur the Embaſſadour of <hi>Sweden,</hi>

                  <p>I am much taken with his <hi>Hendecaſyllables;</hi> wherein I have found the juſt ſtraine that I ſought for in that kind of Verſe, which is they muſt be ſomewhat inferiour to the ſtrength of the Heroick, and yet have nothing of effeminate, as ſome judge they ought, who enervate their ſweetneſs even to ſoftneſſe. But, to tell you the free truth, the Elegiacks of our friend are quite another thing, and carry him from —. Otherwiſe, he is not the firſt that diſlik'd the taſte of Ale, and beſtow'd Poeticall maledictions upon it. This falſe <hi>Bacchus</hi> ha's been curſ'd long ſince, and diſown'd for the true ſon of Jupiter. Do not you remember the Epigram of <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperour.</p>

                  <p>I Have many great obligations to my father beſides thoſe of my birth; but I think I owe him very much for giving me your friendſhip. It is a preſent ſo rich and rare, that I know not whether it was poſſible for him to have made me another of equall value. There is a ſterility of thoſe things in all parts of the earth. There are ſcarce found two men, but I ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and traffick on both ſides, and in a great nation it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult for me to diſcover affection and perſons that love. You are one of thoſe extraordinary goodneſſes, whoſe love is pure and generous, and without an eye to advantage. No body has buſineſs in the deſart, or drives a trade with Hermites: Nor can I repay your civilities with any thing but my good intentions, and return you only a weak and fruitleſſe paſſion, for that efficacious friendſhip of yours which has been ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious to oblige me. You may ſpeak of it with as much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty as you pleaſe: But as for me, I put it in the number of goods that are not ſubject to the infelicity of the times nor to the outrages of fortune. Being poſſeſſ'd of a true friend in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170361:137"/> your Province, I account my ſelf more wealthy then if I were owner of thoſe three pariſhes, which the Counteſſe <hi>Alix,</hi> gave to the great Grandfather of my Grandfathers Grandfather. So that I comfort my ſelf for my poverty in <hi>Angoumois,</hi> in that by your favour I am not ſo in <hi>Languedoc;</hi> and I cannot have loſt any thing in this Country that is equivalent to what you preſerve me there. If my health permit me to make the journey I deſigne, I ſhall declare my reſentments more particularly, and ſweare to you, if it be neceſſary upon the Tombes of our fathers, and by the Genius of our common Country, that I am and will be paſſionately, while I live,</p>

                  <p>I Have been a languiſhing patient theſe ſix months, and at preſent I cannot ſay that I live, but only becauſe I am not quite depriv'd of ſenſe. Yet Heaven has taken care of me in this condition: Some angell that does not hate me hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd me with the charitable thought, which you had of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me with a Letter. The receit of which has awakened me out of my languiſhment to a fuller injoyment of life, and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated thoſe paines which were worſe then death: It has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored my ſtrength by giving me courage and confidence. For, how is it poſſible I ſhould think my ſelf ill, as long as I am well within your favour or dare to complain, with your friendſhip, in your eſteem, and which is yet more, your admiration. You ſee here, how I follow the Language of your Letter, although I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this laſt word is not ſuitable to me among the reſt. But I am not to doubt how it came there, ſince the haſte of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture for the Siege of <hi>Dunkirke</hi> was the cauſe that you were not curious of proper words, but ſerv'd your ſelf of ſuch as came next to hand. There is nothing beſides the Sun, the Ocean and ſuch great works of nature that are worthy the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wiſe men, and yet you are pleaſ'd to profeſs that you have that paſſion for mine, vvhich are ſo ſmall and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in all regards. You give my Verſe the name that is due only to thoſe of Prophets; Wherein my Lord, the honour of your judgment cannot be ſav'd but by the interpretation of your words; and you cannot admire any otherwiſe then as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do Dancers on the Ropes and ſuch as make dangerous leapes. I hazard my ſelf as they do, and raiſe my ſelf from the ground into the aire, and in other places precipitate my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and generally practiſe an Art which I do not underſtand. This is my work when I make verſes. I abandon my wit to fortune, and leave it to be dealt with at her pleaſure, and lead it whither it cannot go alone. So that there is but little commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation due either to the Artiſt or his deſigne. Fortune and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualty muſt be thankt for the ſucceſs. That good goddeſſe muſt have all the merit of an action, to which I contribute
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170361:139"/> only the temerity of venturing and the boldneſs of beginning without knowing what will become of it afterwards. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſince you approve my lucky attempts, I am minded to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from ruine; and reſolve to preſent you with them in full day-light with the advantage of Impreſſion, as ſoon as I am able to dreſs them up for it. But if I durſt, they ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all other eyes, ſince I ſeek no Theater out of your Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. I am,</p>

This affection of mine without queſtion comes from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and the ſtars have ſome influence on it. I am ſenſible of a ſecret violence that conſtraines me, and it is moſt true that I never ſee or think of you, but I feel a kind of ſoft delight that tickles my ſoul. So that the favour you do me in rendring me happy is but juſtice, to my ſtrong and conſtant affection. Since I find there is a neceſſity of loving, I am glad of my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that I have a correlative in the knot which is a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I have ſometimes wanted. I ſhall ſay no more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my ſelf, who am proud of being your favourite, and come to ſpeak ſomewhat of my papers, which receive no leſs glory from your eſteem then I do from your goodneſs. It is no ſmall matter to have pleaſ'd a perſon, who having none but ſound paſſions, can reliſh no other but true pleaſures. The Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of one that is cleer ſighted ought to be prefer'd above the gueſſes and hear-ſayes of the whole people of Blind men. Since you have wit and judgment in perfection there is none that can juſtly diſpute the title of a Judge to you in the works of the mind, and that far before ſuch Doctours as are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170361:139"/> defective in both, who employ knowledge againſt Reaſon, and accuſe <hi>Aristotle</hi> of all their bad opinions. Yet your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are much to my advantage, and you are very liberall in your praiſes of my papers. And what boldneſſe would it be to contradict a Gallant and a Philoſopher together; it would certainly be rather raſhneſs then modeſty, and therefore I am with docility and reſpect,</p>

Yet I dare not addreſſe to him in this occaſion; being I cannot think my ſelf in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to receive of his favours, in that he ha's not accounted me deſerving of the leaſt token of his remembrance. You may pleaſe to know that he came lately into this province without making ſo much enquiry as whether I were in it or no. The neglect is great, and would be a very ſenſible injury to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon leſſe accuſtom'd to ſuffer then I.

                  <p>YOu muſt not think the promotion of Monſieur the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Seguier</hi> cauſes only a particular feſtivall at <hi>Cadillac;</hi> but will be publick and univerſall within theſe four daies. The king ha's done a good deed to all his Realme, and the yeare muſt not be eſteemed happy ſo much for the purity of the aire or the fruitfulneſſe of the Earth as for the election of excellent Magiſtrates. I rejoyce at this newes as a ſubject of the Kings, which is the principall regard wherein I conſider it; but I have beſides a ſecond right to be glad, and that is, out of the intereſt I have in the raiſing of a modeſty, that is known to me, and the happineſſe I apprehend to me in the proſperity of a perſon, of whoſe probity I am perfectly aſſured. I know he ha's preſervatives againſt all the poiſons of the Court, and a reaſon not to be corrupted by all the preſents of fortune. There is nothing of ſo high a value for which he would forſake his vertue. He would have been as reſolute a Martyr under <hi>Nero</hi> as he will be a profitable Miniſter under a juſt Prince. The preſervation of a life of a few dayes is not ſufficient to induce him to ſtain that which muſt remain in the memory of many ages; and the leaſt blot upon his honour would be leſſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170361:141"/> to him then the effuſion of all his blood. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands that in the adminiſtration of juſtice, he is not to make lawes but only to pronounce th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m; that he is the diſpenſer not the Maſter of power; and that ſoveraingty is in the Law and not in him. And theſe are the reaſons, that in every cauſe he takes cogniſance of, he conſiders his own, which muſt one day be heard before a greater Tribunal. He judges, as if Poſterity were to review his decrees hereafter, and the time preſent were ſubordinate to that to come. Having ſeriouſly meditated on the condition of humane affaires, he eſteemes them at their juſt value, and adds nothing to their worth by opinion. He hates neither riches nor authority (which was the fullen hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Cynicks to hate every thing that was lovely.) He but ſerves himſelf of them according the doctrine of the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy</hi> and the <hi>Licaeum,</hi> who did not account them impediments of the Soveraigne good, but helps and conveniences to virtue. I have heard him reaſon in this manner, and ſo drawn theſe concluſions from his principles. In a conference I had with him ſome yeares ſince, he ſeem'd to me yet better then I rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that I could not ſuffer you to rejoyce alone, nor read his Elogy in your Letter without teſtifying to you that I was of that beliefe before I read it, and there was nothing new amongſt the excellent things you told me.

But if you will not permit me to do this act of humility, yet at the leaſt, let me have your conſent to an expedient which I have juſt now conſider'd of. I will either keep the Crown in my Treaſury, or only weare it in ſecret, to avoid offending the eyes of the Publick I will be any thing you would have me in your Letters and your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, but I will not pretend to any other glory before the world, but to be paſſionately affected by you, and as I am, with all my ſoul,</p>

I have ſeen neither the Cheeſes nor the Gennets; neither Verſe nor Proſe; neither the Chancellour <hi>Bacon,</hi> nor the Preſident <hi>d'Espagnet.</hi> I know not what to conceive of it ſeeing the exact and punctuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity whereof you make profeſſion, and I will diſpatch a man on purpoſe to know the truth. I would cauſe him to go with this Ticket, being bound by Oath to write no more Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: But he proteſted he would not preſent himſelf before you with empty hands. He told me moreover, out of his familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with me, that he would allow me to make a ſermon or an
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170361:143"/> Oration, if I were ſo conſcientious as not to dictate a Letter to him; and he ha's thought himſelfe to draw two pieces out of his Regiſter, preſuming you will take delight to read them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he does ſo to copy them. If Monſieur — I ſhould be glad, he may be partaker with you: you know I have a moſt particular eſteem of his judgment, and that a young Cato is worth a whole ſenate of Gray-beards. That which makes me not to hope ill of my French, is, that he did not judge my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin barbarous, and that the inartificiall ſimplicity of my verſe found favour in his eyes. Having fallen caſually from the mouth of him that made them, they ought to have died in the ſecrecy of him that receiv'd them: But their good fortune ha's been greater than their merit; and ſince that time they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſwaded me to think my ſelf a Poet. Being approv'd by a perſon, that is not leſſe of the Court of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> then of that of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, his approbation ha's encouraged me to a new heat; and the honour which he ha's done to five or ſix ſtraglers is the cauſe that has induc'd me to form a Body of ſixty and more: which I beſeech you to preſent him, with the two pieces of the Regiſter, &amp;c.

                  <p>YOur Letter of the ſixth of the paſt month, gives me no new knowledge; it confirms me onely in my old opinions. You are alwaies the father of courteſies, and the common good of the whole world. But you are principally neceſſary to the learned world, and the Common wealth of good Letters. Were it not for you, the Oratours would be perpetually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming in their Orations, againſt the Times and Manners; and the Poets would do nothing in their Verſes, but curſe <hi>Apollo</hi> and the Muſes. The good offices which you do them with his Eminence, temper their bad humour, and give them thoughts leſs violent. So that, to conſider things from their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, there is no Ode nor Panegyrick at this day, whereof you are not the firſt Authour; and Poſterity will be oblig'd to you for all the Latin and French of our Age.

                  <p>MY melancholy corrupts the greateſt pleaſures of my life. I am unſatisfied with the ſweetneſs of light, and nothing
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170361:144"/> in the world would content me, if I had not two or three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in it, that are to me inſtead of all. You are a part of this little world, which I eſteem ſo dear; I have choſen you with the refuſall of the Sun and the Court; and in the moſt gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and ſad nights, only your Idea fram'd in my imagination gives me ſenſible comforts. Therefore what will not your Letters do, which are ſo ſincere and amorous; and infinitely more your preſence, which your Letters promiſe me? But there is no longer a Madam <hi>Deſloges</hi> to invite you to the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; and to hope ſuch a viſite but from the like attractive, is beyond the belief I have of my deſert. Nevertheleſs, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a deſigne of your goodneſs, and you have reſolv'd to make me happy. If there needs no more but the good interval you ſpeak of to bring me that felicity, I ſhall preſently betake my ſelf to my vows to the goddeſs of Health for it. I will compoſe her a Hymne, to obtain a months releaſe from your Gout. And to ſpeak my conſcience, ſhe will not more oblige me in reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me the vigour of my firſt years, in giving me a ſecond youth, yea in giving her ſelf to me, then in granting me thoſe thirty dayes of ſo dear a ſociety. They would be dayes of which I ſhould make benefit every moment, and would requite me for all the time I have loſt amongſt pretenders and falſe friends. My ſpirit which is corrupted by the neighbourhood of bad examples would be reſtored to purity by your excellent communication. You would purge me from all the errors of the people, and the defects of the Country. You would make me live in earneſt. The life of the fortunate Iſlands or that of the <hi>Elyſian</hi> fields; thoſe which the Poets ſpin of Gold and Silke would be but low reſemblances of it—.

                  <p>I Am not much troubled to be dead at <hi>Paris,</hi> provided that I live at <hi>Balzac;</hi> the Letter I writ you about eight daies ſince, hath given you aſſurance of this truth, whereof a flying report had cauſed you to doubt. Though I be not of much value, I perceive, you would have had a ſenſible regret of my loſſe; and I am greatly ſatisfied of your affe n. The onely reſentment I have, is, that your judgment doth not appear ſo favourable to me, as your inclination, and that you refuſe me that agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruit, which I aime at in all my actions; I mean, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of having pleaſed you. You make ſcruple to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170361:146"/> upon the Letter, which I write to an <hi>Achilles</hi> of the cauſe, becauſe a <hi>Thorſites</hi> of the ſame cauſe hath told you, that it diſpleaſed him to whom it was ſent. I have learnt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary from himſelf. And beſides the civilities of his Anſwer, he hath cauſed a thouſand complements to be made me in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by a famous Hugenot of this Province. The compariſon between him and <hi>Hannibal,</hi> both of them ſworn enemies of <hi>Rome,</hi> did him honour, and, I know, was not diſpleaſing to him. The word <hi>Fineſſe</hi> could not any waies diſguſt him; in the place where it is, it ſignifies onely addreſſe, knowledge, and ſubtlety. The <hi>fineneſſe</hi> of a language, and the <hi>fineneſſe</hi> of an art, are termes of no bad ſenſe. And if I had ſaid, that ſuch a Captain, by ſome certain means, had <hi>finely</hi> concealed the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Town, it muſt needs be, that this Captain were more rude then a Gaſcone, and that his bravery extended to a diſlike of good reaſon and prudence, if he took it ill, that I ſpoke of his <hi>fineneſſe.</hi> As for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> I am moſt confident, he was of no ſuch humour, he did not account himſelf affronted, by the recitall ſometimes of his ſtratagems and ſleights; fot it was no more, then to intimate to him, that he not onely knew how to overcome his enemies; but that he could alſo overcome them by mockery and ſport.

                  <p>I Received two of your Letters by the ſame Poſt, which gave me knowledge of ſome newes, whereof I was before igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and confirmed the relations of others. I am alwayes of your opinion, and particularly, concerning the King of <hi>Sweden-</hi> I wiſh onely, that he had not ſo much of the German in his countenance, and that in this great country of faces (as Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> ſometimes called it) he had more brown, and leſſe yellow; more of ſhadow, and fewer rayes. And this, to the end that he might neerer reſemble in his out-ſide, <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi> His pourtrait would pleaſe me much better; for as to his actions, they are all Greek, and all Romane: And I ſee nothing amongſt them, that might not become the dayes of the <hi>Hero's.</hi> The Panegyrick which was made him, ſeems to be obſcure and intangled, <hi>&amp; in eâ deprehendas vitia degenerantis La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinitatis.</hi> The ſtyle of this man was more commendable twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years agoe, he hath learnt to write ill by writing continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is grown a Jade in his Carier. They that have a greater ſtock of judgment then of imagination, are not ſubject to theſe inconveniences; Their eloquence becomes ripe without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their ſpeech; And I am well aſſur'd that the good wine you tell me of will never looſe its ſtrength by age. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſalutes to our dear friends. I am,</p>

The firſt, is all memory and fancy; for judgement, that muſt be ſought otherwhere: for in fifty Conferences that we have had together, I could never diſcover one ſmall glimpſe of it: A great perſonage in Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic! but no body in the vulgar tongue; the ſport of Cavaliers and Ladyes, and a meere Doctor Gratian to you and me, as often as we deſire the divertiſement of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.

Heretofore he endanger'd my life with three great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts, or rather three great Engines in folio, whereof One was called <hi>Overtures made at</hi> St. <hi>Martin's after Eaſter</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>YOu muſt indulge my humour, that I cannot at preſent be ſerious with you. The pleaſant newes of your Letter hath tranſported me into ſuch an exceſſe of jollity, that it is not in my power to refrain ſmiling. You tell me, you are received by favour, into the Academy of good wits, and I would fain underſtand, who received the good wits, that received you? upon what grnund is their authority eſtabliſhed, and whence have they the approbation to be currant? What are thoſe great perſonages, that have done this eſpeciall grace to Monſieur <hi>Chapelain?</hi> from what new diſcovered Countries, are theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary men arriv'd? who, that they may confer honour on Monſieur <hi>Chapelain,</hi> muſt needs be of ſomewhat more worth, then Monſieur the Cardinall of <hi>Perron,</hi> and than Monſieur the Preſident <hi>de Thou?</hi> Tell me yet further, I beſeech you, what is that you call, Director? and that which ******? What ever wonders you may relate me thereof, you will ſcarce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall find a great deal of reluctancy, to adore the <hi>riſing Sun</hi> you ſpeak of. Some have given me intelligence of it, as of a fatall Comet, that threatens us, and a terrible thing, and of more dread, then the holy Inquiſition. They write, that it is a tyranny, which muſt be eſtabliſh't over all wits, and to which it is required, that all makers of Books ſhould yield a blind obedience. If it be ſo, I am both a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell and a Heretick, and intend to liſt my ſelf on the ſide of the Barbarians. This is a great word, but moſt true. You are the only perſon I can allow, to be ſoveraigne of my liberty. And if there be no means to live independent in the world, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, let me not be enforced to acknowledge, either in Verſe or Proſe, any other juriſdiction but yours.

                  <p>I Crave your pardon, for my over great credulity; forgive me, I beſeech you, my fears and my alarms. I am in dread of all ſort of yoaks, and Tyranny caſts me into fear, even in the hiſtories of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> I was ill informed of the nature of your Academy; without queſtion, the picture that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170361:150"/> was ſent me of it, was not drawn after the life. You have done me the kindneſſe to undeceive me; and I well ſee, this new Society will be none of the leaſt glories of the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> it will raiſe jealouſie, and perhaps envy, in <hi>Italy.</hi> And if I have any skill in drawing a Horoſcope, it will in a ſhort ſpace become the Oracle, of all civiliz'd <hi>Europe.</hi> I am glad that Monſieur <hi>the Keeper of the Seales,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Servien,</hi> are admitted of it. But I ſhould be alſo contented, that ſome others, which have been named to me, were not; or, at leaſt, that they had no deliberative voice. It would be well, if they ſatisfied themſelves with placing the chaires, and to open and ſhut the door. They might be of the Academy, but in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Beadles or lay-Fryers: It were neceſſary, that they made up a part of your body, as the Uſhers are part of the Parliament. But it may be, I am miſtaken in my latter newes, and they which were mentioned to me, have not received the honour that is reported; it is probable, you know better how to chooſe. By all means I deſire, that there may be two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Academicians, and that you remember at your firſt ſitting, to ſeparate the <hi>Patricians</hi> from the <hi>People.</hi> I am,</p>

                  <p>I Am extreamly ſatisfied with your Letter, and as much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the requeſt which was made me, by our friend of <hi>Languedoc;</hi> not but that I do very readily accord it to him, but for that I am of the opinion of that honeſt man of old, who ſaid, He had rather have an outrage done him, then an injury offered to his reaſon. I never heard of ſo pleaſant a ſcruple; and if I did believe him the Author of it, I ſhould ſuffer my ſelf to abate ſomewhat, of the eſteem I have of him. But I underſtand, by what head theſe pretty difficulties are brought forth, and therefore ſhall diſcover no further to you. Though the word of <hi>illustrious Stripling,</hi> or of <hi>illustrious young man,</hi> or <hi>illustrious youth,</hi> may afford matter of railery; you know, 'tis a condition of mirth, not to be apprehended as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive; as for inſtance: The appellation of <hi>Salapuſium diſertum,</hi> did not put the Oratour <hi>Calvus</hi> into choler; and <hi>lepidiſſimus homuncio,</hi> was not diſpleaſing to the Poet <hi>Horace:</hi> So that if our friend is jealous, leſt the name of <hi>illustrious Youth</hi> ſhould ſtick upon him, he fears what he ſhould rather deſire, and which a Roman would have received as a great piece of honour. Perhaps he never heard of thoſe <hi>grandes praetextati,</hi> the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of <hi>Cicero:</hi> They were of greater age then he, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Armies, and were Conſuls at the ſame time; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, did not account it an affront, to be treated as young men. But what will he ſay, when he ſhall ſee in the <hi>divine Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>Rinaldo</hi> is in divers places called <hi>Youth,</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:170361:151"/> and even without the additions of brave, valiant, or illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Such men as are illuſtrious, owe a great part of their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to time; but illuſtrious youths are indebted, for neere all theirs. By conſequence, thoſe two ſorts of glories, are much different, and one is fairer then the other; The glory of youth is a light, as it were, proper and naturall to it, and which it ſeems rather to produce, then receive; the glory of riper age, is a light fetcht from abroad, either gotten or borrowed, which ariſes more out of exploits and actions, then from the perſon; and hath greater advantage by the length of life, then the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of the ſubject. But without further Philoſophizing glory, it is neceſſary to comply with the fancies of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and to deal with the world according to its humour. I am,</p>

                  <p>MY words are not ſo dear to me, but that I freely beſtow them on you, to deal with them as you pleaſe; and my Stationer is not ſo ignorant of my affection, but that he might have obeyed you, without expecting my anſwer; you have therefore us'd your power over me, with too much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. There was no neceſſity, to cauſe the diſpatch of an Order ſix ſcore leagues, for an affair, which you might have determined upon the place, and whereto I ſhould have readily yielded my allowance. Since you have not done it, but ſpared to exerciſe your right, I now ſend you my conſent, together with a declaration to you, that my will ſhall ever be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to yours, although it may happen, there may be ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety in our opinions. Nevertheleſſe, I cannot perſwade my ſelf, that the ſcruple you propound me, is your own, or Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Chapelain's,</hi> ſince you are both wiſe with ſobriety, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the precept of the Apoſtle. It muſt needs be iſſued from ſome head of thoſe Refiners, whoſe faculty lies in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of things, already finiſh'd, and are good onely to raiſe difficulties, after reſolutions are concluded. If it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and you the author of this ſubtlety, I believe, I ſhould have known your intention two months ſince, and you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſatisfaction. But there is no ground of likelyhood for this, nor to accuſe you, as the enemy of your Spring, and its Roſes. I do not imagine, that you pretend to old age, and that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170361:151"/> your actions being infinitely fair, you would defalk the moity of their beauty, and your glory, which has appeared to great advantage, for that you perform'd them in the earlineſſe of your youth. The number of illuſtrious men is far greater, then that of illuſtrious youths; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> wept, becauſe he was not illuſtrious till his manhood. <hi>Valerius Corvinus</hi> was called <hi>Adoleſcens,</hi> after he had been Conſul; and <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> after they had triumph'd. Yet none of them miſliked the rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> or complained, of being treated as young men. <hi>Virgil</hi> did not think he ſhould offend the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> when he tearm'd him, as I you:

                     <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks often of <hi>Brutus</hi> in the ſame manner, and his <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps juventutis</hi> ſignifies no more, then the illuſtrious youth of our diſcourſe. He calls <hi>Hircius</hi> and <hi>Panſa,</hi> who were created Conſuls the year that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſlain, <hi>duos grandes praetextaios,</hi> which is a title without compariſon, more liable to raillery then mine. Notwithſtanding we never heard, that they were ſcandaliz'd at it, or that any perſon demanded reparation on their part. On the contrary, <hi>Seneca the father,</hi> thought it ſo good, that he choſe rather to deſigne them by this word, then by their proper names. <hi>In illo atriolo, in quo duos grandes praetextatos ait ſecum declamare ſolitos, potui illud ingenium cognoſcere, quod ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum populus Romanus par imperio ſuo habuit.</hi> You, that know all this, and much more, are not, without doubt, but the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſome friend a little too nice, and you relate me his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and not your own.

                  <p>TO ſatisfie your goodneſs, and give you the account of my adventures, I ſhall tell you, that I am happily arrived at my own houſe, and that I met with neither War nor Enemies betwixt <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Angouleſme;</hi> the news of the coming of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Count <hi>de Braſsac,</hi> had before clear'd the waies of all bad company; he is, undeniably, that <hi>Vir quis,</hi> in the firſt of the Aeneids, whoſe appearance is able to appeaſe a popular ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: And you muſt grant me, that in his countenance he carries ſome kind of reſemblance of Neptune, when he growes in choler againſt the winds. I beſeech Heaven, that the cure of our other diſtempers, be of no greater difficulty then this; and that the <hi>Croates</hi> put us to no more trouble then the <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quans.</hi> They have done too much for good ſubjects, and too little for Rebels. This is alſo an effect of the Kings fortune. Under his Raign, even wickedneſs it ſelfe is innocent, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is diſcreet and reſpectfull. We will treat of this another time more at large: I have need of reſt, and you are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd with Politicks; I am,</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170361:155"/> is full of her great lineage. She hath been ſhewn the name ſhe wears amongſt thoſe Illuſtrious Names, in the Hiſtory of the Cardinall <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> and that of the Preſident <hi>de Thou.</hi> And from hence ariſes that haughtineſſe of ſpeaking <hi>Italian</hi> in <hi>French</hi> Company, and contempt of all kinds of Burgeſs-ſhip and Profeſſions, though cloath'd in Purple, and plac'd upon cloth of Flowers <hi>de Lys.</hi> Her Mother had thoughts leſs high, and more favourable to the long Robe. Nevertheleſs, I can tell you, ſhe is ſollicited every day by divers perſons of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in the humour I left her yeſterday, a Counſellour of the Grand Councill would not ſerve for her Daughter, as twenty thouſand Crowns would be too narrow a fortune for ſuch a perſon.

                  <p>IN this miſerable world, I account petty Miſchiefs in the rank of Goods, and am therefore leſs ſollicitous to bemoan your indiſpoſition. There wants but little to cauſe me rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate with you, ſince it allowes you ability enough to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage all your affairs both of great and leſs importance, and is no impediment to your compoſition of <hi>Rondeaux,</hi> in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of your Heroick Poem. This is an excellent languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the beſt qualifi'd diſtemper I ever yet heard of; mine are of a farre different nature. The greateſt part of the time I am equally uncapable both of action and repoſe, either to pleaſure others, or ſatisfie my ſelfe. I have been harraſs'd with the cruelty of this malady above a moneth, without ſo much intermiſſion as to read the Treatiſe of Monſieur <hi>de</hi> ***. For the Philoſophicall diſcourſe, it was taken out of my hands the ſame day I receiv'd it; and Monſieur <hi>de Braſſac,</hi> who had poſſeſſion of it ſince, hath not yet ſuffered me to ſee any more then the Priviledge, and the prefatory Epiſtle. If he ſhould condemn me to ſtop there, it would be no great injury to my patience. For to tell you freely, I have more longing for the ſight of your Verſes, then for the Proſe of thoſe Gentlemen. But that is a happineſſe out of the way of my Fate, ſince you have not confidence enough in me, to ſend me one ſmall frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that admirable Maſter-piece. I beſeech you, let not the importunitie of my intreaties give you cauſe of diſtaſte. My

                  <p>HAving not yet received any Newes from you, I remaine unreſolved whether the Latine work be Latine: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it be the production of an Author, that eſteems not himſelfe a ſtranger to the Country of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and makes choiſe of no bad examples for his imitation. It is therefore injurious to accuſe the Counſellour you know of, for the father of it. For in my judgement, his writings are of another nature. His Verſes have ſome ſound, and the confidence of the age of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Juvenal.</hi> But every part of this is empty, ſhallow, and tumid, ſtuck thick with high words of no ſignificance; and this harmonious obſcurity is oftentimes the cauſe, that the Readers ſuſpect a Myſterie, where there is nothing but Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſt.

                  <p>IT is not poſſible, for the clouds of my melancholly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo impenetrably thick and gloomy, but that your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters clear a paſſage to let in ſome glimmerings of day, and brightneſſe. They bring with them ſuch ſmall rayes of joy, as priſoners receive at the opening of their grates. The Epicure <hi>Colothes,</hi> with his great Mittain, wherewith he arm'd himſelfe againſt Winter, enforced me to laughter in the bitterneſſe of my pains; and I think an intire diſcourſe of that ſtrain, would afford wonderfull cheerfulneſſe to poor calamitous perſons. I acquieſce in the greateſt part of thoſe advices wherewith you are pleas'd to favour me. But with your permiſſion, I ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my moſt humble Remonſtrances upon ſome of them, yet with no intention of being opinative againſt you. You know I do not believe my own opinions for good, but when I have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170361:158"/> perſwaded you to allowance, nor have an aſſurance of any truth, till you confirm it to be ſuch.

There will be great pleaſure to ſee the Grammarians exerciſe their wits upon thoſe vacuities, and take much pains to fill them.

                  <p>IT is rrue, that being at <hi>Paris,</hi> I ſent a copy of my laſt Book to <hi>Sedan:</hi> And this, without other deſigne, then in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a cuſtomary civility, and to avoid the complaints of a perſon, that perhaps expected it. He returned me for it the complement, that I ſhewed you, whereunto I thought my ſelf obliged to anſwer. But I fear, our friend has made him too particular a diſcovery, and contrary to my intention: For, though I had ſeen the laſt year, that paſſage of his Latin Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, for which I am not extreamly beholding to him; yet I diſſembled my knowledge, and forbore to vaunt of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; I would not let him underſtand my reſentments of it, leſt I ſhould put him to the pains of giving me ſatisfaction. I am not ignorant, that ſatisfactions are oft-times the ſeeds of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170361:159"/> ſecond quarells; and that a vain man, yea one of much mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, is not eaſily induced to unſay, what he hath ſpoken, but with reluctancy.

The late Monſieur <hi>de Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbe,</hi> was one of his particular friends, and made ſometimes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170361:160"/> mention of him, but onely as a perſon extreamly curious, much affecting relations and ſtories, a great ſearcher of Medalls and Manuſcripts, a great profeſſor of knowledge in ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, a great admirer of all the Doctors of the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> &amp;c. All this in my opinion is too little, to make up a grand perſonage. I do not queſtion, but he was alſo reſpectfull and faithfull to his friend.

I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as to uſurp upon you, who are immediately inſpired by the god <hi>Apollo;</hi> or to endeavour to gain the repute of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, for fear, leſt that new quality ſhould draw with it upon me, a new perſecution. I cannot have admiration enough, at their depraved guſt, that diſlike my ſpeaking of my ſelf, in an affair that concern'd no body elſe, and where I could not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any other, without digreſſing from my ſubject. Would they have me talk of the <hi>grand Signior,</hi> or the King of <hi>Perſia?</hi> or dilate my ſelf upon the pedigree of <hi>Meſſieurs de</hi> —? I am not fit to commend theſe great Lords, in ſo mean a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — would diſcharge that office better. But I muſt acknowledge, that all the obloquies of the inconſiderable rout, do not ſo much move me, as that word which was whiſpered in your ear, by Monſieur the Keeper of the Library. From whence I gather, that to pleaſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe, in this honeſt age, are the meer effects of fortune and hazard; wiſdome and ſufficiency have no ſhare therein. And according as the phyſick of my Lord — hath had good or bad operation, and that he ſlept well, or otherwiſe, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a favourable or hard cenſure, upon whatever is preſented him. This breeds in me ſometimes a reſolution, to hate all mankind. And if you were not the onely good and juſt perſon, amidſt this univerſall degeneracie, I ſhould make a ſecond vow, yet more ſolemn and religious, than the firſt. In my own opinion, I never writ any thing more modeſt or commendable, then the Piece now in queſtion; and yet becauſe it is no, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of the <hi>Palace,</hi> or preachment to the Vulgar, it is ſleightly eſteemed: Thoſe that afford it praiſe, do it with a great deal of indifferency and reſerve, becauſe they know not how to blame it, without rendring themſelves ridiculous:

He muſt not permit the mediocrity of his reaſon, to ſtrain forwards, having learn'd from you or me, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe it ſhould move in. I do not doubt but you are ſurpriſed, even at the title of the litle <hi>Father's</hi> Letter, and that <hi>Balzac l'Orateur</hi> does not extreamly pleaſe you. Although he cannot confer that quality on me, without diſplacing Monſieur <hi>de Colomby,</hi> who is Oratour to the King, and uſurping upon the <hi>Jacobins</hi> and <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> who are your moſt humble Oratours.

                  <p>I Received much contentment from the eſteem you make of <hi>Monſignor della Caſa.</hi> He is one of my old intimates, and the late Monſieur <hi>de Roccellai,</hi> his great Nephew brought him firſt to my knowledge. I have lately read with diligence all his Writings in the vulgar tongue, and am proud that it was my chance to paſs of him the ſame judgement, which you out of an aſſured knowledge allow him. I concur in your opinion of the Latine, of the ſame Author. The life of Cardinall <hi>Bembo</hi> is a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170361:166"/> very handſome piece, judicious, and Elegant. That of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Contareni,</hi> is longer, but not ſo compleat, and <hi>Victorius</hi> himſelf, confeſſ'd it ſtood in need of being review'd to attain its ultimate perfection. The Italian-Manuſcript, which I intend to print, is nothing inferiour in its nature to the Oration made to the Emperour upon the reſtoring of <hi>Placentia:</hi> At leaſt it is ſo conceived by many honeſt perſons beyond the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;</hi> and ſome think it was ſo offenſive to the Spaniards, that they endeavour'd to be reveng'd on him by the poyſon'd mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that was given him. He that your Letter ſpeaks of, is one of them, whoſe perſons I eſteem more then their Books; and when I would repreſent his worth and attractions to my ſelfe, I leave this quality out of his Picture. Is it poſſible that a man wholly unskilful in the Art of writing, and whom the King had not commanded to make Books upon pain of his life, ſhould quit the rank of an honeſt man he held in the world, out of deſign to gain that of impertinent and ridiculous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Doctors and Schollars.

You have pleaded the cauſe of <hi>Virgil</hi> to admiration, and I believe, that, after this, no <hi>Lucanist</hi> will be confident enough to ſhew his head, but every one is ready to diſown his Jargon, his Rodomentado's, and his miſhapen pourtrait upon his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For, in earneſt, it ſeems to me, that in their Verſes, I behold the deform'd wreathings of their countenance they uſe in compoſing them, and the pains they put themſelves to, to ſwerve from their own genius. The greateſt part of the people of <hi>Leyden,</hi> are of the ſect of <hi>Lucaniſts,</hi> or at leaſt their Allies and Confederates. If they do not imitate all the bad, or perhaps dangerous examples; yet they ordinarily leave the Reader to divine what they would expreſs; and notwithſtanding all my induſtry and ſearch, I could never yet attain to underſtand them perfectly. Poſſibly it may be my fault, but it may alſo be ſometimes theirs; and ſince <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> and other honeſt men of Antiquity, have not excluded me their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; certainly theſe might communicate to me their ſecret, without injury to themſelves. They believe that clearneſſe of expreſſion, is the language of the multitude; and, that to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves from the prophane vulgar, it is requiſite to ſpeak like Prophets, and not to be intelligible to poor Mortals, but by the mediation of Grammarians. I cannot induce my ſelfe to that beliefe, and I am ſure father <hi>Bourbon</hi> is of my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; although, to tell you freely, he more then once devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates into that bad tract, whereof he gave us caution, and has quitted his own <hi>Virgil</hi> for the <hi>Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Claudian</hi> of others. But this I would have taken under the Seal of civill confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I am,</p>

                  <p>MY curioſity is ſatisfi'd, and you have done me a great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, by giving me ſo exact information of the affair of the Priſoners. I think it was fear'd, the Abbot had intentions of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170361:168"/> raiſing a ſect, and that he might be probably the leader of a Hereſie. I do not mean carnall and diſſolute Hereſies, like thoſe of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin;</hi> but ſpirituall and ſevere, as thoſe <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Montanus</hi> were Authors of. I could dilate much or this ſubject, if our Letters could be turn'd into diſcourſe, and you were either here, or my ſelf at <hi>Paris;</hi> Yet I will offer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this purpoſe. This Man is indeed an extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a great Divine, a great Philoſopher, and as full of high ſpeculations as I ever knew any. He oftentimes ſpeaks things that ſeem inſpir'd to him, and to come immediately from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Amongſt others, he aſſur'd me one day, that he ſaw the myſteries of the other life more evidently, then I did the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this. It is true, the demonſtration he brought did not convince me, but <hi>I</hi> believe, rather through my incapacity then his fault. If this man be deceiv'd, <hi>I</hi> acknowledge the ſame errour, and it is great pitty for the reſt of us poor mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, who ought to humble our ſelves continually before the Throne of God. I can never be perſwaded that he pretends to the quality of Head of the Party, or that it was any of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to broach Opinions. For no perſon in the world could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more reſpectfull to the Holy See, or better ſatisfi'd of the Omnipotence of <hi>Rome.</hi> He is otherwiſe a great admirer of the Writings of the late Monſieur, the Cardinall <hi>de Berulle,</hi> and I cannot imagine what induc'd h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>OUr new friend is of too nice a palate, and that which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſts him, is neither harſh nor unſavory. I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his reaſons to think it ſtrange, that I ſaid, If I were born a <hi>Swiſſe,</hi> I ſhould approve no other Government but that of my own Country; ſince the ſuppoſition I make, is to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Government of that Country wherein I was born. Beſides, <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> are two words almoſt every where oppos'd, <hi>Non facilè libertas &amp; domini miſcentur;</hi> and in another place, <hi>Res olim diſſociabiles miſcuit, libertatem &amp; principatum.</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:170361:169"/> Whereas I affirm, the change even of bad things, to be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; if he conſider the preceding words, they cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Religion. My intention is of things, purely civill and politick. And is it not true, that in States, there are ſome pieccs ſo tickliſh and delicate, that they cannot be touch'd without overturning? Tender conſtitutions cannot bear me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and are incapable of curing; they muſt be left in the condition they are found, for fear of bruiſing when they are ſtirr'd. A ſleight touch and motion, even without violence, or the paſſage from one bed to another, is ſometimes mortall, to ſuch weak bodies; yet they are able to endure a long time, if they be not moleſted, but left to the care and conduct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Quiet preſerves them, though in a ſtate of decay, and amongſt their familiar and accuſtom'd maladies. Should they be wakened, or turned onely from one ſide to the other, their life being included in their inſenſible drowſineſſe, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening and change would prove fatall to them. Such are the dangerous conſequences of ſome alterations. When our young friend has ſeen as many Winters as we, he will have no better opinion then we, of thoſe that go about to reform the world. Let him ſurvey the Hiſtories of all Ages, and he will perceive, that this zeal of reformation, has given birth to new diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, inſtead of rooting out, and aboliſhing the old.

                  <p>Since the King does not approve, that men ſhould ſay, Monſieur the <hi>Dolphin</hi> is a Child of Wonder; can he, in your judgement allow, that our friend, ſpeaking to the Queen, ſhould term her, <hi>his Queen?</hi> And is not this familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170361:172"/> ſufficient to give him apprehenſions of jealouſie? It is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admirable, what he ſayes of <hi>Tagus</hi> and <hi>Rhine,</hi> that their Channels would have been dry'd up, unleſſe they had receiv'd ſupplies from our tears; as likewiſe where he beſeeches Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Dolphin, to come and viſit Monſieur the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. I do not queſtion, that if Monſieur the <hi>Surintendant,</hi> or even Monſieur <hi>Cornuel,</hi> had given him the ſumme of two hundred Crowns but he alſo had been one, whom Monſieur the <hi>Dolphin</hi> ſhould have been deſired to viſit. This is you ſee, a man very acknowledging of favours which he receives, and ſpares not the viſits of new born Princes, where there is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to thank his benefactors. But when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured <hi>France</hi> in their imagination, what induces him to name <hi>Quercy</hi> amongſt the principal objects of their appetite, which is no more then a member of the Government of <hi>Guyenne?</hi> Certainly it was to fit a Rime to <hi>Nancy;</hi> and this laſt ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was the cauſe that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſlighted <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi> &amp;c. to gain a little corner of <hi>Gaſcony.</hi> In another place, it ſeems he had forgot that there were Rivers of Wine in the golden Age, as well as Rivers of milk; and that <hi>Jupiter</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Saturn, paſſim rivis currentia vina repreſſit.</hi> But, pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, he preſum'd to alter the Fable, for the better concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Period, which you know is no more ſufferable in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, then the falſification of holy Scripture in Divines. He is otherwiſe a very gallant man, and makes excellent Verſes here and there. To tell you freely, nothing I have yet ſeen upon this great ſubject, tranſcends mediocrity.

                  <p>VVHatſoever information the enemy of <hi>Car</hi> may have given you, I intreat you to believe my affections are moſt conſtant and immutable. I have alwaies had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular eſteem for <hi>Victorius,</hi> although I am conſtrain'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to you, I do not greatly admire the Letters and Orations I lately read. They reſemble thoſe Wines which are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed corrupted, yet their worth exceeds not the rate of eight pence a Gallon, to uſe the compariſon of the late Monſieur <hi>Malherbe.</hi> He commits no ſoleciſmes, he is no Barbarian, but a native Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> though a very mean Plebeian, and has nothing to render him conſiderable, but the place of his birth. You cannot imagine what reſolution is neceſſary, to proceed ſometimes from one page to another. To read the whole Book is no leſs toyl, then to travail over all the plains of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> afoot, and without company. <hi>I</hi> do not wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it is ſo ſcarce, but rather ſhould have counted it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, if there had been two Editions. Some of his prefaces created in me a deſire to read his Letters, which nauſeated me ſo much, that I ſhould fear being ſick, unleſſe yours do reſtore my appetite. As I do not approve of Salt and Pepper by handfulls, ſo notwithſtanding my infirmity and ſqueamiſhneſs, I am not ſo ſuperſtitious as to diſlike all manner of ſauces, and alwayes to obſerve the rules of a ſick mans dyet. 'Tis a health more grievous then diſeaſes, which obliges us to abſtain from thoſe things which we moſt affect. <hi>Cicero</hi> in divers places of his Works, derides the ſoftlineſſe of ſuch Orators, as have neither ſtrength nor vigour, and are equally undeſerving both of puniſhment and reward: We may rank this perſon in that number; you would think he expir'd at the cloſe of every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, and had no more life then one juſt a dying. In a word, he no wayes playes the Oratour in his Orations. But from hence it muſt not be concluded, but he may be otherwiſe learned and judicious. And even in this, although I am weary and harrſs'd with ſo tedious a Lecture; yet I preferre his meanneſs and ſlow pace, beyond the loftineſſe and impetuoſity of <hi>Ciam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli, Malvezzi,</hi> and many other high-flown wits on the other ſide the Mountains.

No civility was wanting on my part in Monſieur <hi>Costar's</hi> entertainment. I had his company here a fortnight, and during that time, you were both the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and agreeable ſubject of our diſcourſes. Truth obliges me to this teſtimony, that, I never knew any man have a more reſolute perſwaſion of your worth then he.

Upon diligent ſcrutiny, and ſounding all the receſſes of his heart, I find that in former paſſages, there was not ſo much malice as bravery, and more of accident then deſign. But I can aſſure you, he hath an extream regret for what is paſt, and acknowledges that even Innocence it ſelfe muſt be eſteemed culpable, if it ſhould offend a vertue like yours. He hath given me ſo full ſatisfaction therein, that I have made him a promiſe of your love, and judged it of no neceſſity to require of him ſuch Remonſtrances, as himſelfe, by a Letter to you intended. Your goodneſs makes me confident it will not be unpleaſing to you, to have gain'd a friend, and loſt an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

                  <p>THough nothing is able to aſtoniſh me, yet the ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement of Monſieur the Preſident is a very ſtrange and ſurpriſing adventure. I make you no queſtions thereupon, nor will I examine whether he were immediately inſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt. Second cauſes have no influence in this alteration, as unhappy ſucceſs in love, diſcountenance of Superiours, or ſome defeature of that kind, which you may perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. His piety is not occaſion'd by diſcontent, or laſſitude
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170361:176"/> of ſpirit: Neither is it the iſſue of a faint courage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency. Nauſcouneſſe is uſually of thoſe things that have glutted and overthrown the appetite, and we become weary of ſuch profeſſion, which our affections at firſt carried us with moſt violence to embrace. Our ſtrength, if unthriftily hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, grows enervate and languid, and with that, our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. But this caſe affords no ground for ſuch conceits, The continuance of ſo troubleſome an employment, might perhaps ſeem inſupportably burdenſome to ſome other mans ſhoulders, though ſtrong and laborious. But this perſon, had a clear and unqueſtionable reputation, beyond that which his eloquence and admirable pleadings had gain'd him at the Barre. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution will poſſibly be variouſly interpreted, though to my ſelfe, I ſhall make no other judgement of it, but civill and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable. I would believe that he was not able to withſtand the power of Grace that drew him from the world, and that God was vanquiſher in the combate betwixt him and man. But what moves him to ſpeak ſo much of his faults and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, in the Letter which he writ to Monſieur the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour? I know that was the ſtyle of St. <hi>Francis;</hi> but yet it ought not therefore to be drawn into example, both you and my ſelf, can ſufficiently teſtifie, that, he never committed any exceſs except that of ſtudying, and has no debaucheries, but ſuch as are honeſt and vertuous.

                  <p>THe dayes whereon I receive your Letters, are remarkable to my ſmall family, by the ſerenity of my countenance. I am not cheerfull but when it pleaſes you, nor have I any contentment but that which the Currier brings me with your Packet. You evidence an exceſſive goodneſſe and charity, in ſatisfying my importunate curioſities ſo punctually, and taking ſuch particular care, of a perſon altogether unprofitable unto you. Yet you conceive what you doe, ſhort and deficient, and complain of the tenderneſſe of my conſcience, that I forbear to diſpatch you, after your overthrow; for to require of you the news of <hi>Rambouïllet Hostell,</hi> as you apprehend I did, were it not to oblige you to be the greateſt Hiſtorian of this Age, and to ſend me the relations of an infinite number of excellent
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170361:177"/> things that are diſcours'd every day in that faire part of the World. You know, that <hi>Dies unus expraeceptis ſapientiae traduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, peccanti immortalitati anteponendus eſt.</hi> That is, in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tongue, that one day in the Hoſtell of <hi>Ramboüillet,</hi> is more valuable then many Ages otherwhere; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the Acts of one week in that Country, conſidering the importance and worth of things would comprehend more matter, than there is in ſeverall decade of other Hiſtories. I underſtand ſuch matter as deſerves to be known, and affords both inſtruction and divertiſement. In which reſpect, I am not minded to charge you with the moſt precious, but yet the moſt weighty burthen that I know in the world. I deſire but one ſentence, one half of a period, or one ſmall word, of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam the Marchioneſſe <hi>de Ramboüillet,</hi> in repeating of which, it would be very difficult to determine, whether the Mother of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> were more abſolutely <hi>Romane</hi> then ſhe, in regard of ſpirit and vertue. The Eloquence of that ancient <hi>Cornelia,</hi> was ſutably extoll'd by them of her times. And we muſt alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, to the glory of ours, that her words are fram'd with no greater proportion of ſolid reaſon and judgement, than they are of modeſty and honour.

                  <p>THe feminine Senate, that aſſembles every Wedneſday at the houſe of Madam — is, in my opinion, an odde conceit. But <hi>Cato</hi> would have termed it a diſeaſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which ought neceſſarily to be redreſs'd; and on ſuch an occaſion the old Romanes would have ſent to conſult the Oracle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> what ſo great a Prodigie might por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.

                  <p>IN requitall of the newes, of the great World you ſent me, I impart to you thoſe of our Village. Never did Nature cloath our fields with more beauty, and delightfull verdure; nor were the trees and corn more florid and promiſing. The Sun does not employ all thoſe beams, he did in <hi>April</hi> the year paſt, when he burnt up the herbs in the tenderneſſe of their birth; his hear is mild, innocent, and ſupportable to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt heads. The coolneſſe and dewes of the nights ſucceed in their courſe, and yield refreſhment, to what would languiſh upon the earth, without their ſuccour. But having rather laid the duſt, then made it dirty, it muſt be granted, they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute no ſmall ſhare, to the pleaſure of thoſe rare mornings we enjoy. I am very ſolicitous of loſing the leaſt moment of them, and preciſely begin them, at half an houre after four, and ſo continue them without intermiſſion till noon, during that ſpace, I walk abroad without wearineſſe, and in ſuch places, where I may conveniently ſit at my pleaſure. I read Books, that do not oblige me to meditate, and my ſtudy is with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent attention; for at the ſame time, I do not ceaſe to liſten to an infinite number of Nightingales, wherewith our thickets are inſpired. I paſſe my judgment of their merit, as you do of that of Poets, in the place where you are; and indeed, if you are ignorant of it, I aſſure you, there is as much difference between Nightingale and Nightingale, as between Poet and Poet. There are ſome of the firſt, and ſome of the inferiour Claſſis. We have enough of <hi>Maillets,</hi> and — and alſo

                  <p>THe father <hi>Narni</hi> is an Orator, whom I admired in the Chair, but do not ſo upon the Paper; in the little that I have read of his book, I have obſerved very many poeticall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and cold alluſions, together with certain fables in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed; which, as they do not pleaſe me in any place, ſo I abſolutely condemn them in Chriſtian eloquence. Beſides all which, I know not who can allow him, to alledge before the Pope, and the ſacred Colledge of Cardinalls, <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro, Caelius Rhodiginus, Pierius Valerianus,</hi> and other like Authors, ſo little deſerving of the honour he doth them, and ſo remote from his argument; in a word, who have nothing to do with the grandeur of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> and the Majeſty of the holy Goſpel. I perceive hence, that the father <hi>Narni</hi> was well born, but badly enough inſtructed; and that his defects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from his Maſters and his Books, but that he owes his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence almoſt wholly to himſelf; he ſpeaks ſometimes in a high and noble ſtrain, and even in the Book, in which there are ſo many cold alluſions, and poeticall expreſſions, and where <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erius Valerianus</hi> is quoted, there are ſome incomparable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages.

                  <p>I Am redevable unto you, for the exact juſtice you have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, in your laſt Letter, to our friends of antiquity; I have drawn particular inſtruction from it, as from all the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and my expectation was not greater then my ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But, I cannot deny, The demand you make me, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — has ſomething ſurpriſed me; he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands more of my affairs, then my ſelf; and it is fit he be both moſt-great, and moſt-good, ſince he beatifies me in my life-time, and by his own private authority. I am all matter, earth, and body, and yet they ſell me about at <hi>Paris,</hi> for a man made up of quinteſſence. 'Tis a favour done me by my News-Merchant, and a vertue he is pleaſed to endue me with: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe I believe, he does not report, that I let my beard grow at length, or curtail the collar of my jerkin. I have ever ſo much diſapproved ſingularity of this nature, that although I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence the younger <hi>Cato,</hi> yet the uncleanlineſſe of his hands,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170361:179"/> with his torn and dirty Gown, and his locks horrid and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, are very far from commending him to my eſteem. The action of Monſieur the Preſident, is an heroicall exploit, which muſt not be drawn into example, and infinitely tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends my capacity and endeavours. I have not wing enough for ſo high a flight; nor know I how to take ayme at things, beyond my view and comprehenſion. But as I am ſhort of thoſe perfect ones, who have no other object of their thoughts, but the felicities of Heaven, ſo I beſeech you to believe, that I am more remote from the number of thoſe hypocrites, who drive a trade upon earth with dejectedneſſe and ſoure faces; I have not falſhood enough for ſuch carriage. I never affected to appear better then I am, becauſe I alwaies lov'd my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation leſſe then truth. Had I been capable of the cheat of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, I had certainly found fortune more favourable, then ſhe has been, and the Seigneur <hi>Jean Jacques</hi> ſhould have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me at this day, with the title of <hi>my Lord.</hi> But in reality, I prefer liberty before command, and priſe my quiet, more then the dignities of others. You ſhould ſee a clear proof of what I ſay, if they at Court would take me into conſideration, and confer on my ſilence, what the Doctors canvaſſe for every day, by their Sermons; the world ſhould then know, that I am no vaunter of Philoſophy, &amp; you receive the pleaſure of having a friend, that did in earneſt refuſe Biſhopricks.

There are ſome Books, and ſome wits, which he cannot endure. He would ſuppreſs two thirds of all Libraries, and the moiety of Univerſities. A perſon of ſuch ſavage melancholly, ſhould never dream of coming abroad out of his retirement, and the pleaſure which he takes in deſpiſing all things, ought to reſtrain his deſires of being any thing in the world.

                  <p>THe ambitious thoughts of Monſieur — in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and the glorious offers he many times propoſes to you, cannot but give you ſtrange apprehenſions of him. You muſt excuſe the heat of his zeal, and make your ſelfe pleaſant with all his ſplendid promiſes.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170361:181"/> might with juſtice expect the like favour that was granted to an Advocate of <hi>Picardy,</hi> who is not capable of returning any conſiderable ſervices. But herein I diſſent from my friend; having learnt a long time ſince, that there is no Robe ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming a Philoſopher as his virtue. Wherefore, Sir, after acknowledgements to you for the good will you have teſtified towards me in this occurrence, and the ſollicitation you have already begun; my requeſt to you is, that you would ſurceaſe the continuance of it, and inform Monſieur the Abbot — that my appetite is not ſutable to the deſires of my friends. I find my ſelfe ſo feeble, and overburden'd with divers evills, that even an other name annexed to mine, would weigh me down, and a naked title, though without charge or employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can afford me onely trouble and inconvenience. I would willingly have written to Monſieur —, but I am wholly unprovided of matter to do it, Neither my Rhetorick, nor my Muſes, yield me any thing upon thoſe ſorts of arguments, If I knew a maker of Complements, and Marriage-Sonnets, I would purchaſe ſome of his Merchandize at a Piſtol a line, though Piſtols alſo are not made in my Village. This is to tell you, Sir, I am no longer able to do it; and you may more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over excuſe me, that there was no great appearance, I ſhould perform civilities upon a ſubject of marriage, ſince I fail'd in the duties of humanity, and afforded nothing to my antient affections, upon occaſion of the death of Monſieur <hi>de</hi>— It is neceſſary therefore, for my honour, that my Letters be kept ſecret, to avoid offending ſuch perſons as I reſpect; and it is of much importance, that every one be aſſured of my indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to the end, no body may complain of my ſilence. To morrow, I will ſend Monſieur the Commiſſary, the Letter which you writ to him; I have opened it, and find it very judicious and diſcreet. But diſcretion is the univerſall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of all your writings, and you are very circumſpect in the leaſt actions of your life. I am,</p>

                  <p>I Perceive, Monſieur <hi>de la Broſſe</hi> had not intentions, onely to oblige me, but to do it gracefully, and after a noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; this is to make two favours of one, and to underſtand the Art that <hi>Seneca</hi> teaches. But he is better skil'd in other matters, and I know not, if I told you when I was at <hi>Paris,</hi> that as often as I had the honour to entertain him, I was dazled with the raies and luſtre, that proceeded from his wit. At that time, I ſpoke without intereſt. It is requiſite now, that I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn my acknowledgments to my eſteem, and beſeech you, to give him aſſurance of both. I am now falling to work in good earneſt, for our incomparable Marchioneſſe; and you may tell him before hand, that I hope to relate ſome wonders, of his Rome, and his Romanes. There ſhall be perhaps a little Book, divided into ſeverall Chapters, for the better conſideration of the parts; and when that is finiſhed, I muſt bethink my ſelf of another deſigne; for I have a work in my head, which I intend to intitle Entertainments, and ſhall be of a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and leſſe oratoriall ſtyle; but yet ſuch, as ſhall not be leſſe gracefull and pleaſing. To authoriſe the title, I have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of two Authors, that have paſs'd before me, namely, Monſieur the Biſhop of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and our dear Monſieur <hi>Bardin.</hi> who impos'd this name upon ſome of their works. It will ſuit exactly with my book, it being in effect, the abridgment and extract, of all the converſations, I have had with your ſelf, and other choice perſons. I ſhall therein diſcourſe, either with my friends, or concerning them, and I think, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interreſſed commerce ought to be more approved by them, then Letters of complement, which almoſt ever ſignifie the ſame thing. I renew my former reſolution, and renounce them this laſt time more ſolemnly then ever. Therefore, dear Sir, oblige me, by forbearing to preſſe me further thereunto; and remember, that for all others, except you, I am at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but paſſionately at <hi>Balzac.</hi>

The Tickets of other men ſeem tedious unto me, but ſhould you write me whole Volumes, I ſhould account them ſhort. And I have no reaſon to complain, that you diſpenſe your favours ſo liberally, and by handfulls. All that you write is conſiderable, and over-payes the Reader's patience. The greateſt part of poſthumous pieces, are either ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, or very unworthy of the name of their fathers, to whom thoſe injurious offices are ordinarily performed, if not againſt their order, at leaſt, beſides their intention. Yet this does not excuſe the feebleneſſe and flagging ſtyle of <hi>Victorius;</hi> for his Orations, which were not written without meditation, are more weak and dead, if poſſible, then his Letters, on which it is evident, he employed no ſtudy or diligence at all. The funerall Oration of <hi>Coſmo,</hi> deſerv'd the height and excellence of Oratory. But I cannot judge it tolerable, and without doubt, he has done injury to the reputation of that great Prince, not to ſay, that he has ſcandaliz'd his memory. In truth, he did deſerve to have been told, at his deſcending from the Chair, <hi>O indignum fatum principis tui, bis mortuus eſt; ſemel per morbum, iterum per te.</hi> I am,</p>

                  <p>TO judge exactly, and like a Maſter, of the Comedy which you have done me the favour to ſend me, it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be deeply learn'd, or to have more knowledge, then I have of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s ſecrets and yours. I call that new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſo, which you diſcloſe to your favourits, and whereof our Poets underſtand no more, then it pleaſes you to teach them. Nevertheleſſe I ſhall not forbear to declare my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in expectance of your determination, and to tell you, that the <hi>Suppoſez,</hi> as I conceive, are far from doing prejudice to the reputation of <hi>Orlando,</hi> their elder brother. If I can judge any thing, there cannot be a more ingenuous, handſome, or better contriv'd ſtory, then this; and <hi>France</hi> never yet ſaw any piece of this nature, that deſerv'd to be compar'd with it. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible, to bend the gravity of our Verſe, and ſuit it to the familiarneſſe of ordinary converſation. Neither do I much approve of Proſe upon the Theatre; and Verſe without rhyme, in the opinion of our friend <hi>de la Tournelle,</hi> have little of life or pleaſure. Unleſſe you oblige the Stage with a Comedy, We are like to have no <hi>Ariosto</hi> amongſt us. But I confeſſe, I never peruſed this, but in the bulk, and without deſigne of ſtrict examination. You may pleaſe to reſolve me, if my firſt view has deceived me, and whether my judgment be not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. However it be, the concernment is not ſo great to me, as to require my care: Good or bad, true or falſe, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame thing now adaies, and all the world undertakes to judge, though in truth, there is nothi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I muſt further add to this Ticket, the report which one lately acquainted me withall, that there paſſes a Libel at <hi>Paris,</hi> whereof ſome conjecture me the Author; if it arrive at your ears, you may confidently ſwear, without fear of perjury, that I intermeddle not with things of ſo foul a nature: You know how well I love my quiet, and how gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally backward I am from all manner of writing; I am ſo far from ſupererogating, that I oftentimes fall ſhort of my duty.

                  <p>THe affair of <hi>Arioſto</hi> is, it ſeems, in the mouth of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and has occaſion'd factions and parties. For my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I have gone in that way my reaſon ſuggeſted for the beſt, without imagining that I concurr'd with you, and I merit not your thanks, for following my own opinion. I had no other object but truth, which, it was ſaid of old, ought to be choſen, with the deſertion of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and in whoſe cauſe we ſhould not ſcruple, to oppoſe, not onely the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of our friends, but even our own inclinations. Upon this conſideration, I have ſome hopes of the converſion of our dear, Monſieur <hi>de Voiture,</hi> who knowes, that <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> hath written his retractations, and that there are ſome Lawes that are abrogated by others; as alſo that none hath the gift of infallibility, beſides our holy father the Pope, when he ſpeaks <hi>ex cathedrâ.</hi> It is fit to aſcribe glory to God, who alone has the poſſeſſion of truth, and is not capable either of errors or repentance.

This ingenuous confeſſion is almoſt as honourable as the victory. In all regards, an accommodation is better then a duell; and I had rather be reconciled with <hi>Arioſto,</hi> then be engaged in a combat againſt his Knight. This <hi>Astolpho</hi> is a dangerous man, and wo be to them that incur his diſpleaſure. As to my ſelf, I account his friendſhip as a piece of good fortune, and am very proud of the new teſtimony he has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me of it.

                  <p>IF I happen to ſee that gallant perſon againe, of whom your Letter makes mention, and who is ſo dexterous in ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Benefices of five hundred Crowns revenue, I ſhall contain my ſelfe from eſteeming him either <hi>Phocion</hi> or <hi>Ariſtides.</hi> The judgement of Monſieur <hi>de—pace tanti viri dixerim,</hi> is ſometimes right, and not alwaies ſo. The underſtanding of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170361:184"/> Monſieur <hi>de</hi>—has very narrow limits, and as the firſt does ordinarily attribute too much to himſelf, ſo does the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſet too high a value on the firſt; whether it be, that he owe him ſome ſmall ſumme, for which he payes him conſideration in this manner, or any other leſs materiall intereſt that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces him to ſuch conceits. They are both of them ſtrangers in that Country, whereof I eſteem my ſelf a Denizen, and the little acquaintance they have with the Ancients, is the cauſe that they deal with ſo much equivocation and ambiguity in matters which concern the Moderns. If they had onely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the pains to read the Apology of <hi>Apuleius,</hi> or that of Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> againſt <hi>Rufinus,</hi> they would have learnt, that all ſubjects are not capable of the ſame ſtrength or ornament; and have obſerv'd other manner of inequalities there, then in my Diſcourſe. I will ſpeak nothing of thoſe knowing Ladies, which they have drawn to their opinion, but onely this, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my ſelfe ſubtile enough, to be able to deceive them at the firſt reading at leaſt, as well as ſome bad Poets of the ſtage have done. I confeſs, it never entred into my thoughts to chooſe them for my Judges, and hence it is that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſo ſpeedy a ſentence upon a man that did not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to plead. 'Tis you, Sir, who are the rule of Truth, and it is not poſſible for me to doubt the certainty of your reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo long as I have your voyce in my favour; I ſhall not be ſollicitous, to repair a buſineſſe wherein the curious igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſome — does rather make then finde defects. This perſon does me a kindneſs beyond my deſires; and I could not believe, that there was ſo much freedom in the Country of diſſimulation. I alſo wonder how the moſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of all Mortalls, came to quit his obſequiouſneſſe for my concernment, and did not rather in compliance with his friend, pronounce the ſecond moiety of equall merit with the firſt. However it be, I ſhall not much lay this unhappineſſe to heart. The world is become ſo delicate, and I may ſay, faſtidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous too, that it often diſreliſhes more commendable things then mine, I cannot dilate further upon this ſubject, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Totila's</hi> abſence, whom ſome affairs have taken from me.

                  <p>YOu may moſt aſſuredly believe, that my minde is in equall ſufferance with yours; and that I ſwallow a part of that duſt whereof you ſpeak. But beſides this, I am not without my peculiar unhappineſſes, though I have likewiſe ſome good news to impart to you. In requitall of the ſtory of your break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up houſe, you ſhall receive that of the death of three of my Horſes, and the ſickneſſe of the fourth. It muſt needs be, that either the Goddeſs <hi>Hippona</hi> is ſtrangely incens'd againſt me, or ſome other pernitious <hi>Demon</hi> is grown envious of my <hi>Promenades,</hi> and has deſign'd to force me to go a foot, and ſo deprive me of the onely remaining pleaſure of my life. This inconvenience is more grievous to me then my laſt, which though it would be perhaps not inconſiderable to a man that had both a grand and little Eſcuyrie; yet I reſent no more of it, then the preſent diſturbance, and the trouble I ſhall have to move, till my poor equipage be repair'd. The want of a Caroach is a miſery inſupportable, to the condition wherein I am; and though Philoſophy may place it in the number of things ſuperfluous, yet my infirmity makes me account it amongſt the neceſſary. Having affirm'd thus much, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to tell you further, that I apprehend more contentment, in being extoll'd in that manner, then by all the Elogies of the Academy.

Nevertheleſſe, Sir, I would not be miſconceived, as offended thereat; and that my diſguſt of the laſt weeks actions, drawes theſe ſpeeches from me. Whatſoever I have written to you, I beſeech you to believe, that I know with what ſubmiſſion and docility, I ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every thing, that is tender'd me by my friends. Onely I think, the freedome of friendſhip ſhould not exclude diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that faithfull counſell is not us'd to be given in publick. Therefore Monſieur — might have forborn raiſing himſelf, to be Monſieur the Judge; and rather thought, he had been leſſe attentive in reading the ſecond
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170361:185"/> part, then ſaid of it, that it was of leſſe ſtrength then the firſt, which is onely a civill accuſation of its weakneſs.

But although we ſhould agree in the acknowledgment of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, yet being, as I am, continually afflicted and in miſery, I deſir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> rather conſolation then counſell. Provided there be neither hereſie nor incongruity in my writings, I eſteem all the reſt, as undeſerving the trouble of reformation. I prefer indeed a buſineſſe accompliſh'd, before that which is to be done, and is yet onely in deſigne.</p>

Yet <hi>Caſaubon</hi> has written excellent obſervations in his Exercitations, againſt the Cardinal <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.

The handling of the Mathematicall Sciences, is a far different buſineſſe, in my opinion, ſince they have no community with the precepts of Morality; and their myſtery depends not, either of the Greek or Hebrew: They require a very abſtracted ſpeculation, and muſt be attended with that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170361:186"/> ſubtlety of apprehenſion, that I conceive it not difficult to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the way, in a path ſo obſcure and narrow. Yet I think, a knowing and judicious perſon, that has read all the antient Fathers, and is skill'd in all the tongues of the Eaſt, may, with ſucceſſe, publiſh what he has gone ſo far to ſeek, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up at ſeverall Ports and Countries. As to the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous — he has ſomething too much toleration; it is not fit he be ſuffer'd to rule ſo abſolutely, but muſt be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in mind of <hi>la Berne,</hi> and perhaps that may make him for the future more wiſe. Monſieur — would do well, to extend his charity ſo far, and try, if the fear of puniſhment may happily divert the effect. But what prodigy is that you tell me? Is it poſſible, that a perſon, that is indu'd with one grain of common ſenſe, can prefer the Spaniſh Poets, above thoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> and conceive the viſions of one <hi>Lopez de Vega,</hi> to be rationall compoſitions. This is it that perſwades me, there are ſometimes falſe judgments made, in the cabinets of the wiſeſt, and that there is hazard in the iſſues of the brain, as well as in the affairs of the world. I appeal from this injuſtice to our excellent Marquis, who will never miſtake apparences for truth. But can it be true, that this brave Marquis ſhould not be treated anſwerably to his worth, and that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to encounter, with all the fury and hardſhips of the North, without allowance of neceſſary ſupport.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170361:186"/> upon your ſoul, which is all Adamant in your own. Such ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs is not unbecomming the ſtrength of <hi>Hero's;</hi> and, if they have ſometimes lamented the loſſe of a Dog they lov'd, you may certainly be allowed to condole with a friend, for the death of four Horſes, that were of neceſſary uſe unto him. In thoſe daies, they would have deſerved four Epitaphs; but they are now too well treated, in that they are ſorrow'd for by you; and the unfained tears you ſpeak of, are more glorious to them, then a <hi>Bucephalia,</hi> and all the Grecian vanity could invent, to conſecrate dead things to perpetuall remembrance. I hope, in a ſhort time, to fill their places with others, becauſe I cannot live, and be without them; and that my weakneſſe is of more reality then your tears. When I relate you my afflictions, I borrow no Rhetorick, to repreſent them in a larger proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I am an Hiſtorian, and make you a faithfull narration. I cannot conſent to you, that the uſe of the Caroch is but a ſhadow of exerciſe; there is not indeed ſuch violent agitation, as in other ſorts, yet there is a continuall motion, that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes enough to the advancement of digeſtion.

My infirmity makes me wiſh ſome other carriage, of more gentleneſſe and eaſe; and the <hi>Geſtatio</hi> of the old Romans, is exactly ſuch, as I ſtand in need of. Were it not to provoke the tongues of people, I would provide me a Pulpet, and cauſe my ſelf to be carried by men, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn by horſes. The perſon of whom I told you, and whoſe character you have ſo ſutably delineated, is departed from this Province, with the curſes of the whole world. If the Tax be continued, all this Country will be turn'd into an Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. For my own concernment, I have great reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his civility, for that he had a more mercifull regard, to all ſuch as I recommended to him. But I fear, in a little while, it will be neceſſary to recommend my ſelf, and that Orators and Poets will not be eſteem'd as priviledged perſons. You well remember the field that was taken away from poor <hi>Virgil,</hi> and the complaints that he makes thereupon in his Eclogues.

But, Sir, if I remember, it was not upon this empty and trifling reading, that I chiefly grounded the learning of Monſieur <hi>Heinſius.</hi> Beſides the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall Languages, which they report him skill'd in, he is of great naturall endowments, and has exact knowledge in ſolid Antiquity, and the Philoſophies of old; and yet further, ſuch ſagacity in matters of Criticiſm, that his conjectures ſeem ſometimes to approach near divination: Notwithſtanding, it is poſſible he may decline in his old daies. And 'tis a common word amongſt his Orientalls, that <hi>Vinegar is the ſon of Wine,</hi> and that Time begins to prey upon things, as ſoon as it has brought them to their perfection. But let us relinquiſh thoſe Gentlemen, the Rabbins, and give me leave to deſire ſome knowledge, of the affairs of our friends. Be pleaſed to make me underſtand, how Monſieur <hi>d'Ablancourt</hi> is at this preſent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, and if he intend not a Panegyrick, in honour of his eminency, having cauſed others to diſplay all their eloquence upon that ſubject. He is a perſon of ſufficiency, for whatever he will undertake, on whom I have beſtow'd my heart, and my eſteem, and who muſt not be forgotten in my <hi>Entertainments.</hi> Let me alſo know, if Monſieur— has finiſhed his Treatiſe, of Counſells for War, whereof you gave me notice. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this day a Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and a Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> in the world, does he not fear the miſadventure of that Doctor, that diſcours'd of the ſame matter in the preſence of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and employ'd all his Rhetorick, to make himſelf ridiculous? Theſe Princes are indeed more polite, then that Barbarian was, and our friend more expert then the Sophiſter; and therefore I

Without diſpute, he is one of your great friends, or at leaſt one that has propounded you for his pattern; and I am confident, your Ode for Monſieur the Cardinall, was his firſt inſpiration. I ſhall ſay nothing where I have met with moſt ſtrength or weakneſs in his Poem, but forbear at this time to exerciſe my skill in Cenſure.

Having already given you ſo exact narration of my misfortunes, it is but equitable to inform you, of the good requitall I received by this laſt Poſt; 'tis a Letter from Monſieur <hi>Conrart,</hi> which makes me the proudeſt man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth; and if there be remaining any ſhadow of humility in me, yet I triumph at leaſt within doors, and keep holy-day in my Cloſet. To tell you the truth ſincerely, I never yet ſaw a Letter, more ingenuous, rich, and noble: and for that you ſpeak of it, as if it had never been in your hands, I thought
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170361:190"/> my ſelf obliged to ſend you a copy of it, to the end it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the common ſubject of our admiration and applauſe. Does not this Gentleman make you recall to memory, the firſt Nephewes of <hi>Remus,</hi> who were wealthy, without having pillaged the Gold of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and learned, before they underſtood the Language of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> They were, I ſay, rich, with their own poſſeſſions, and learned with ſuch knowledge, as was peculiarly their own, and unborrowed. It muſt not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, that poſterity be ignorant of this wonder of our age. And if my writings have that ſtrength of conſtitution, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the aſhes of their parent, (as he is pleaſed to imagine in my favour) he may be aſſur'd, it ſhall never be, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them bear ſome eminent teſtimonies, of the eſteem I have of his great worth, and the friendſhip wherewith he has done me honour. The father <hi>Palavicino</hi> gives me no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, concerning the Comedies of <hi>Ariosto;</hi> and the <hi>grande Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo,</hi> whereunto he requires our belief, is more then one degree above my apprehenſion. I cannot diſcover more excellency in the great Poem, conſidered in its kind, then the Comedies have in theirs; and as to the point of regularity, you know there is no compariſon. It may be therefore, that <hi>Palavicino</hi> is a great Scholar, but this part of learning lies out of his road. To be a native of <hi>Italy,</hi> is not a ſufficient qualification, to create a man Dictator in the Commonwealth of Literature; witneſſe the Poet of <hi>Luca,</hi> for whom <hi>Camuſat</hi> lately printed a volume of Verſes, which, in my opinion, are far ſhort in value, of the paper of the Impreſſion.

                  <p>I Advertiſe you before-hand, that I intend no excuſes in this, for my not writing to you; it is rather a proteſtation to aſſure you, that I ſhall give you no further trouble in that kind, but leave you in repoſe, to employ your onely care, in advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the immortality of your own glory, and that of your friends. Nevertheleſſe I have imagined, that after a ſilence of above a years durance, I might happily oblige you to the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170361:190"/> reading of a few lines, provided I did at the ſame time oblige you, to return me no anſwer. This is now a favour which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of you, with as much paſſion, as I us'd heretofore to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your Letters; the eſteem I bear them, is in as high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as ever; but I content my deſires with thoſe, which you write to Monſieur <hi>Chapelain,</hi> as well as if they were addreſſed to my ſelfe, and I have found the device to imagine them ſuch, and that I make you all the anſwers, which you receive from him. So that, without loſſe of time to you, in regard of me, or of my prayers and importunities, we enjoy a mutuall commerce, which puts you to no trouble, and affords me a great meaſure of delight and contentment. I have had a ſight of the remarkable judgment you paſs'd, upon the <hi>Suppoſez</hi> of <hi>Arioſto,</hi> wherein I am much taken, both with your equity, and your addreſſe, and have equall admiration of the profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your capacity, and the politeneſſe of your wit. Never was ſeen a Judge ſo well accompliſh'd, and ſo little prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt; nor a ſentence more juſt and better grounded. There needs no rigid and ſevere decrees, to conſtrain it to execution, every one acquieſces in it without reſiſtance; and even thoſe that accounted it their glory, to have never yielded, have thought themſelves obliged to a ready approbation, of what you ordain. I have read, with no leſſe contentment, that hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Apology, which is in the keeping of Monſieur <hi>Chapelain;</hi> it has been the ſubject of divers Academicall conferences; and all that ſaw it, after they had ſurvey'd all the perfections of it with wonder, could find no other fault in it, but its brevity. I aſſure you, there was ſcarce one lecture of it, but drew theſe expreſſions from the Auditory. When will it be our happineſſe, to ſee compleat Volumes of ſuch excellency, as this Diſcourſe? And why cannot we prolong the life of this incomparable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Author of it, with the like facility, as he renders all thoſe immortall, whoſe names deſerve a place in his Writings? I had intended to finiſh my Letter here, but this laſt word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces me, to make a requeſt to you, for a ſpeedy ſight of your rich Miſcellanies, wherein we ſhall unqueſtionably behold, all the beauties of Art and Nature, in the height of their glory and luſtre, and the pomp of ornament, ſo delightfully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, with the genuine and ſimple comlineſſe, that the contexture, though of nothing but naturall and ſupernaturall, will appear moſt gracefull, without either diſorder or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Eloquence will have there, ſo dextrouſly contriv'd all
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170361:191"/> its force and artifice, yet without making ſhew of any, it will notwithſtanding animate the whole body, with ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and action, as will raviſh all the world. Suffer us not to languiſh any longer, in expectation of our happineſſe; and be pleaſed to believe, that amongſt all thoſe that deſire the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of it, there is not any more perfectly then my ſelf.</p>

Notwithſtanding, your deſire may prevail with me, for ſecrecy, and the wiſe perſon be ſuffer'd in the guilt of his folly, without knowing our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the action. Your perſpicatious reaſon, has diſcovered the true cauſe of his prodigious inequality, and the article which you write me concerning it, deſerves to be inſerted in a convenient place. This may be effected without difficulty, <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſo authorum &amp; paraphraſtarum nomine;</hi> and you may intruſt Monſieur— upon my intereſt. I will not deſcend from a Theſis to an Hypotheſis.

                  <p>I Have very tender reſentments of your loſſe, although your gain could not have promoted the concluſion of the War. Since <hi>Briſac</hi> has wrought no advantage to it, I am no longer of belief, that peace is in the power of men; Heaven muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity become engaged in the affair, and it muſt be the work of God, and not ours. Yet let us not, in the mean time, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our ſelves to grief, nor diſpair of the Common-wealth, although after a Battle of <hi>Cannae.</hi> At the worſt, we may ſave our ſelves in the Sanctuary, that Philoſophy has built for us, againſt the misfortunes of the world; I mean, the Philoſophy of <hi>Plato,</hi> for I know you affect not that of <hi>Chryſippus;</hi> and I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with you, in diſlike of that ſtep-dame of the paſſions; (as one tearms it) which in order to the deſigne, of making a true wiſe man, that is, living and ſprightly, repreſents him no other, then a dead and inſenſible image. This kind of Statues are more ſutable, for the ornament of the <hi>Porch,</hi> then for the uſes of life; and, as I conceive, there is between hardneſſe and ſoftneſſe a middle temperament, which is called Firmneſſe. The Piece that this Poſt will deliver you, contains ſomething per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not impertinent to this argument. I have ſome weak ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of its beauty, by the perſuaſion of ſome here that think it fair; but Monſieur <hi>Chapelain</hi> having not yet pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon it, I am wholly unreſolved in what quality to eſteem it.

                  <p>SHould I credit your Relation, I muſt uſe much vertue to reſtrain me from vain-glory. My Writings deſerve not the commendations, they have receiv'd at <hi>Ramboüillet Hoſtel,</hi> and the honour beſtow'd on me, ſeems more properly the due of my Lord the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette.</hi> But, in the mean time, where was the dear Monſieur— that conſtant and perpetuall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of <hi>F. N. C.</hi> whoſe diſpoſition is ſo ſweet, that hony and ſugar are bitter in compariſon? * * * * * * * * * * The gravity of our other friend, is alſo rare and admirable; and I believe, the <hi>Areopagus</hi> never ſaw any thing more ſober and compos'd. Be pleas'd, Sir, for my ſake, to call my Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation a Diſcourſe; for, beſides the properneſſe of the Title, and that it is <hi>Oratio ad Cardinalem,</hi> (there being ſome much ſhorter in the Books of the Ancients, eſpecially in thoſe of the old Greeks) you know, I deteſt the name of Letter, <hi>cane pejus &amp; angue.</hi> Yet it is neceſſary the Muſe of the Fennes have a Copy, ſince you ordain it ſo, and I have no power to diſobey you. But this muſt not be drawn to an example, and you muſt bear with me another time, if <hi>la ſignora Principina, ò la ſignora</hi> —write to me, and I return them no anſwer. What miſery is this to be oblig'd, to make Elogiums upon all Books that are publiſh'd? 'Tis certainly to be in a worſe condition in Proſe, then the <hi>Auratus poeta regius</hi> was, who did with a good will, what I do by force, and as condemn'd to. I have with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row underſtood the death of poor Monſieur <hi>Arnaud:</hi> He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a perſon of great worth, and I lament the caſe of the Gentlemen his Brothers, who are very deſerving, and for whom I have ever had a moſt ſincere affection, but full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

But, Sir, my principall ambition is to ſatisfie you alone, whoſe leaſt ſcruples give me more trouble, then all the declared hoſtilities of all the Doctors and Academies of the world can do. You may judge from hence, if I eſteem and allow the curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Monſieur <hi>de Scudery,</hi> who intends to rank you amongſt his Illuſtrious perſons. I onely deſire that he would be careful of placing you with ſutable companions. For beſides the great Poet, which I acknowledge you to be, I account you alſo an eminent Counſellor of State, Secretary, and Ambaſſadour; in a word, a perſon moſt accompliſhed in all things: And I never give any other Character of you, to thoſe that demand of me, who that perfect friend is I have at Court, and of whom I make all my glory. <hi>Et haec non animo adulatorio &amp; ad aulicas ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes compoſito dicta ſint.

But I cannot endure that he ſhould drive a Trade with them. It muſt needs be, that he has little knowledge of our Court, ſince he addreſſes himſelfe to Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to be his Soliciters, and to gaine him kindneſſe from a man they never ſee. He is yet more ſtrangely miſtaken in the choiſe of his ſubject. For you may believe, that if he eſcape being derided for his <hi>Pangloſſie,</hi> he will at leaſt receive but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thanks for this. Monſieur the Cardinall may willingly bear with his Panegyricks, and pay him for ſome of them; but he is not concerned in a Funerall Oration, for people that he never heard of.

I think he will not refuſe you; and if you will do me the pleaſure to ſend them hither, I ſhall return them with ſpeed, and before he can imagine they are gone ſo long a journey. This <hi>du Vivier</hi> had a pretty way of raillerie, and becauſe it may be thought I had ſome ſhare in his death, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my ſelfe obliged to perform ſome duty to his memory. He writ me word by the Meſſenger from <hi>Blois</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> that he had loſt his Father, and that himſelfe ſhould infallibly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, unleſſe I comforted him for that affliction. I was negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, after my cuſtome, and rendred him not the office he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at the time appointed. As for him, he made good his word, and the following Meſſenger, by whom I intended my anſwer, told me the perſon to whom I addreſſed it, was no longer of this World. Behold a fatall ſloathfulneſſe, and which may give warning to all people that write to me in that

But the perſecution of the other is inſupportable, and I ſwear unto you, I would never have ſaid a good word of her, if I had known ſhe did ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually aſſaſſinate you with her Writings. I ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun long ſince to deplore your fortune. The — would needs heretofore play with me at that ſport, but I was more valiant then you, and acquitted my ſelfe of her couragiouſly. She made a thouſand falſe thruſts, and I received a whole Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell of Tickets, but without loſing one jot of my dumbe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. This is the way to treat Ladies of that kind, whether they be Muſes or Fairies; or, which you love better, Sybils. You ſee my old practice, I am ready to do worſe in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: 'Tis not becauſe I am full of imployment, but for that I am ſo diſcontented, and weary with the continued torture of my maladies, that I know not on which ſide to turn my ſelf. I am in great fear for <hi>Piedmont,</hi> that is, for you, and a little Nephew I have there, who may poſſibly be troden down in the croud. Our friends are of great worth, but the Princes of <hi>Savoy</hi> muſt not be neglected; and there being brave ſpirits on both ſides, I apprehend a terrible ſlaughter, unleſſe Heaven avert it. I am proud of the good opinion that Monſieur <hi>Spanheim</hi> has of me; for he is a perſon whom I infinitely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem. If there be any thing of his abroad, beſides the two Books which I have already ſeen, I beſeech you inform my Stationer of it, and let him ſend them. Otherwiſe, I never make any uncivill requeſt, nor deſire to ſee that which is kept ſecret. Hence it is, that I mortifie my curioſity with my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and am contented to know, that Monſieur <hi>le Maistre</hi> can make nothing but what is rare and excellent.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Saw yeſterday the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucaut,</hi> who told me many things, and amongſt the reſt, that your <hi>Signora Vittoria</hi> takes the little man we know, for a little fool: It is the more likely to be true, becauſe the number of that Order is very great; and yet it may not be ſo, becauſe the Court oftentimes condemns a man, for a wry mouth, or one ſimple look. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170361:195"/> from the ſame Author, that <hi>Moſes ſaved,</hi> was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and paſſion of Monſieur and Madam of <hi>Liancourt.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I have received the book of <hi>Holſtenius,</hi> and the <hi>Tyrannique Love</hi> of Monſieur <hi>de Scudery;</hi> by the reading of which, I muſt confeſſe to you, I am ſtill warm'd and agitated. 'Tis true, there are ſome few things in that piece, which I could wiſh he would alter, and himſelf may take notice of them; but the reſt are in my opinion incomparable, which move the paſſions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſtrange manner, which make me ſhed tears in deſpight of me, and are the cauſe, that the <hi>Kid</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> are no longer my favourits; perhaps it is, becauſe we ordinarily judge, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of things and perſons that are preſent, and forget what is paſt. However it be, I ſhall not be diſpleaſed, that Monſieur <hi>de Scudery</hi> underſtand, he hath done what he would with me, and hath taken me down from my altitude of Philoſophy, to range me amongſt the common croud. But I beſeech you, Who is that gallant perſon, whom you call Monſieur <hi>Sarraſin,</hi> and who calls himſelf, Monſieur <hi>d'Arbois?</hi> The name pleaſes me, as well as the remembrances, and I yet honour the memory of that precious liquor, which I ſometimes prefer'd before that of <hi>Spain</hi> or the <hi>Canaries.</hi> Setting aſide raillery, Monſieur <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſin</hi> is an excellent Doctor, and diſtributes many things after a moſt agreeable ſort. I will be beholding to you for the reſt, if you pleaſe, and underſtand from you, <hi>Qui genus, unde domo, quibus aut mihi venit ab oris.</hi> I could hartily wiſh he had the ſame ſentiments for me, I have for him; there wants but little, that I do not this very hour demand his friendſhip; I, who otherwiſe am far enough from ſearching out acquaintance. But this will one day happen, my minde ſo gives me, and I ſhall willingly lay hold of an occaſion, to let him know, what eſteem I have of h s deſerts. But would you think it poſſible, that Monſieur the Duke <hi>de Rochefoucaut</hi> had never heard ſpeak of our Monſieur <hi>de Peiresk?</hi> and that many other, not ignorant or barbarous people, know him no more then he? You ſee by this, his reputation was good, but that it was the Italian Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieur, who enterpriſed to make it great; and that his <hi>Pangloſſie</hi> was rather an effect of his own ſolicitations, then a voluntary devoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, made known to the people. I would the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> could find as good a friend, and who would take as great a care of his memory. It was he who ought to have been celebrated, in thoſe forty tongues, and who merits the name of <hi>Hero,</hi> which we have given ſo good cheap, and which title
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170361:196"/> many people unworthily hold of our grace. I ſpeak not here of his firſt marvails, nor intend to compile his Hiſtory. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of you, if the Hiſtory of <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelfe, is imbelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with a fairer year then that, in the circle of which he gained three Battles, took three Towns, and made priſoners three Generalls? Yet my muſe hath revealed to me, he wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf, by performing ſo much in ſo ſhort a time; for he put a fallacy upon death, who believed him older then he was, taking the laſt fifteen months of his life for an entire age, becauſe in ſtead of counting the Time, death reckoned the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories. You ſee, I have a little elevated my ſtyle, in the end of this Letter, and have ſomewhat forgotten that plain fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar way, we have obliged each other to keep in our privacies; but you are much more faulty in that then I, and inform me by all the <hi>Courriers,</hi> of things which ſeem extreamly ſtudied; if they have fallen negligently from your quill, at leaſt they have been collected with much care, and the art of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing them, is nothing inferiour to the ſenſe. Suffer this proteſtation which I make betwixt us, and know, there is not any perſon in the world I eſteem ſo much as you, or any who is ſo perfectly as my ſelf,</p>

Write me, if you pleaſe, but a ſingle monoſyllable, and treat me as briefly, as the Lacedemonians did <hi>Philip,</hi> I ſhall be ſatisfied; provided you ſigne that ſyllable, and it contain newes from you.

Since you are of opinion, that the reading of the Apology, would not be altogether diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your excellent Marchioneſſe, I ſhall cauſe a new copy of it to be written out, and will ſend it you ſo ſoon as it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Make me underſtand, I beſeech you, what that ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous mode means, of certain people, that at mid-day, and when no cloud obſcures the Sun, cauſe themſelves to be ſerv'd with Torches.

And that you may know, your friend is a Weymarian, as well as you; I muſt let you underſtand, that that <hi>Hero,</hi> a little before his death, made an enquity after me and my ſtudies, with ſuch care, as well teſtified, he attended ſomewhat from them: Monſieur <hi>Feret</hi> his Secretary, a perſon of much worth, writ this in a Letter to Monſieur <hi>Borſtel,</hi> from whom I heard it. I never ſaw in Italian the conſpiracy of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ovan in Ludovico Count of Trieſque;</hi> but aſſure you, the French Tranſlation of it is a piece, I do not much admire, and the Epiſtle is but coorſe. I am now far entred into the quarrel of <hi>Annibal Caro,</hi> but have nothing changed my firſt ſentiment, and I ſtill eſteem him an honeſter man, then his Antagoniſt, though perhaps the other may be the greater Clerk. No Grammarian I ever yet ſaw, hath that addreſſe and force of this <hi>Modenois,</hi> either in this, or in the Commentaries he made, upon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Poetiques; yet it muſt be acknowledged, he ſometimes ſins through his too much ſubtlety, and that he is an enemy of mankind, who cannot bear the merit or reputation of another.

                  <p>VVHatever inclination the party you know of, hath to ſlandering, I cannot chooſe but think him a brave boy, nay, a gallant man, ſince he is now enriched with a beard; if I love him not with that ſacred friendſhip I have for you, at the leaſt I can afford him ſuch a paſſion, as ſhall nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode me, and yet extreamly ſatisfie him. I will put him in the number of Mountebanks, of Perfumers, Violliſts, makers of Ragouſts, and all thoſe Artificers of pleaſure, which are <hi>virtuoſi</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and who, as you know,
<q>Delectant Copetane, non amantur.</q> That generation of people were baniſhed from <hi>Sparta,</hi> but were eſteemed amongſt the <hi>Sybarites;</hi> and for my particular, I regard them, becauſe I have need of mirth, and am not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed. I have no obligement to love them, becauſe I deſire to love few. They are the cure of my diſtempers, and the cauſe I ſuffer not out of my ſelf; at the leaſt, they ſpare me thoſe alarums, which ordinarily torture true friendſhip. For Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>de Voiture,</hi> he is alwaies himſelf, that is, alwaies a moſt excellent perſon; and if at any time it hath been ſaid, Nature was never greater then in little things, let us convert that to the advantage of his Tickets, and prefer them before Volumes of Aſiatique Authors. I deſire from you the continuation of his favours, and intreat you to aſſure him of my ſervice. There are few perſons in the world I eſteem ſo much as him; but amongſt thoſe few, you are alwaies to be excepted. The Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis was lately ſent me, which I read without much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but in that tumultuary view I had of it, I remarked ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gallant things, and perhaps the obſcurity of certain paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in it, proceeded onely from my careleſſneſſe in the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall. I ſay nothing to you of the invention of the fables, but for the manner of expreſſing them, it ſeems a little too far ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and puts me in mind of that antient Oratour, who could not give the <hi>good-morrow</hi> without a figure. But what will you ſay of the other party, who enjoynes me to read a much larger piece, but of a far leſſer merit; he may as ſoon perſwade me to

I was never acquainted with all its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies till this day. I am very farre from the compariſon of the coal, with which you are pleaſed to ſmut it, and much fear I ſhall want words rich enough to ennammel it; yet I ſhall not fail to enterpriſe that, though I have onely Lead to ſet it in. And be pleaſed to know, (without pretending to thanks for it) there is no work of mine in which you ſhall not be ſeene on the right hand, and on the left; The Copy you did me the favour to ſend me, is moſt exquiſite, and that way of writing pleaſes me much more then the way of ſome other Ladies, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their Letters: they preach and declaim a great part of the time, and their Letters <hi>in folio</hi> are no other then groſſe bodies ill animated; in lieu of which, all in this peice is full of ſpirit, and which ſmels not of the lamp.

I am not one of thoſe that make a ſecret of every thing, and much leſſe of thoſe that divulge Myſteries. Though my freedom be directly oppoſite to the ſervitude of Courtiers, yet I deſire it ſhould be diſcreet, and not injurious to my friend or my ſelfe. This advertiſement, may, if you pleaſe, ſerve for all, and you may ſleep in aſſurance as to this particular. If for the future you do not look upon me as a Confeſſour of the ſhort Robe, your diffidence of my taciturnity, will accuſe you of doubting the power of Philoſophy over the minds of men. But, Sir, you have ſent me ſo lively a Portraiture, that I could eaſily beare the want of the Original, if he ſhould ſave himſelfe the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

He affords me the honour of his love, and he may be aſſured, he has not a more faithfull and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate ſervant in the world, then my ſelfe. Monſieur the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>de la Rochefoucaut,</hi> has one of the <hi>Meſſieurs d'Eſprit</hi> with him, who does me the favour to give me a viſit ſometimes of three or four dayes.

I know no perſon more worthy to be the elder Brother of him that is with Monſieur the Chancellour, whoſe merit is likewiſe generally approv'd of all the Court.

                  <p>THe Poſt has faithfully acquit himſelf, of all that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted him with in my favour, for which I confeſſe a new engagement to you; but more eminently, for the two moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, moſt exact, and, according to your cuſtome, moſt oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letters. The gift of Urbanity, which you congratulate to Monſieur <hi>de la Thebaudier,</hi> will be undoubtedly pleaſing to him. I have ſent him your Letter, but I had neer forgotten to thank you for it on my own part: And ſurely, Sir, it is fit I do, ſince I am as much intereſſed in it, as he; and you therein am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie my ſmall merit, with your accuſtomed exaggerations. I am very ſenſible of theſe teſtimonies of eſteem, becauſe they are alſo evidences of love, and the heat where with your words are animated, is too naturall to come other whence, then from your heart. But, Sir, what are the intentions of our dear Monſieur <hi>Eſprit?</hi> his civilities fill me with confuſion; he either mocks me, or is good and generous even to exceſſe, as well as Monſieur his elder brother, who is not contented to excuſe the poverty of the Village, but alſo miſ-imployes his good lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in commendations of the bad cheer, wherewith he was received. I treated him onely in the faſhion, of the good man in the Georgicks:
<q>Qui dapibus menſas onerabat inemptis.</q> and made him no other complement, then that in the ſame Author;
<q>Aude hoſpes contemnere opes &amp; te quo<expan>

                     </q> Notwithſtanding, he would have the whole family charg'd with all theſe favours, which are ſo empty and leight, and whereunto onely his acknowledgment gives a a body. How eaſie is it to oblige perſons, that act by noble principles! 'Tis I, Sir, that am infinitely accountable to them, for their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous affection; and ſince I am deſtitute of all means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170361:202"/> my gratitude, by my actions. I conjure you to aſſure the two brothers, which are at <hi>Paris,</hi> that I love, eſteem, and honour them all three perfectly. I return you the catalogue of Italian books, wherein I ſee not any thing of value. Is this the rich Library of the curious book-merchant? I much pity the hard hap of his widow, if ſhe be ſuch as ſhe is repreſented to me; and if I were one of thoſe Grandees, that lov'd the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſo well, I would not ſuffer her to periſh for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170361:203"/> amiable and deſerving qualities. Let us not exact more of poor mortalls, then the proportion of their fortunes will allow. It is not a crime to be no Philoſopher: All of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion have not equally abandon'd matters of intereſt. There have been ſome that have made as importunate ſupplications as this, that have receiv'd denials and affronts, and inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the favour of the Pages of the Syracuſan Tyrants.

                  <p>In ſtead of requiring conſolation, you ought rather to rejoyce in the poſſeſſion of the vertue, which is contrary to that ignoble vice, and congratulate your health in the time of a Peſtilence.

I would gladly continue this Diſcourſe, and acquit my ſelf of what I promis'd you by the laſt Poſt; but my attendance on a great company with me, will not afford me leaſure. I am confident, you will allow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wit and language of Monſieur the Duke <hi>de la Rochefou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caut,</hi> as alſo that of Monſieur the Prince of <hi>Marſillac</hi> his ſon, to be ſufficient and lawfull cauſes, of referring you to another time. Yet I muſt not end here, without telling you, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived about three hours ſince, a rich preſent from Monſieur <hi>de la Menardiere.</hi> All that I could do ſince that time, was, to read the diſcourſe at the entry of the book, wherein I confeſſe, betwixt the ſtrength of his reaſoning, and the ſolidity of his doctrine, I perceiv'd ſo quick and glorious appearances, and in ſo great number, that I yet remain dazled with them. Did I yet practiſe the writing of Letters, I would not fail to teſtifie to him, the reſentments I have of ſo dear a favour. But it is poſſible, I ſhall one day render him ſome more conſiderable act of my gratitude; and I hope, that after I have ſtudied his book, it will furniſh me wherewith to alledge it. <hi>Par verò mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ne à nobis unquam expectes, praestantiſſime Capellane, ſed ſi per egeſtatem noſtram referre gratiam non licet, ingenui ſaltem animi erit profiteri per quem profecerimus.</hi> I am,</p>

And ſince your flegme has ſuch an extraordinary inundation, you may be ſuffered to accuſe the ſtarrs, and complain of the diſpenſations of Nature. As for me, let Rivers forſake their Channels, and overſwel their banks as long as they pleaſe; let the Dog-ſtar die with cold, if he will, and let it freez and ſnow upon our harveſt; I know, the worſt evill is already paſt, and the ſucceeding diſorders will ever be more ſupportable to me, then the firſt.

You become what perſon ſoever you pleaſe to act, and there is an equall mixtu e of prudence in all your performances. I have ſeen within a few daies, a man whom you much prized to me, in two very different poſtures: And at the concluſion of his Poetry, which pleas'd me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, I fell by misfortune upon theſe Verſes, which made me ſick at heart, and wherewith I am ſomewhat conſcientious to ſully white paper.</p>

                  <p>I Send you here with the Letter of a gallant man of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, which he deſired might be communicated to you; and I muſt tell you, he is perſwaded upon my words, that he is a Maſter Artiſt at writing of Letters. It is therefore a juſt judgement of God, that I am now perſecuted with the impertinences which I formerly commended, and that my flattery reaps the thornes which it ſelfe had ſown. He ſeeks occaſions to write to me, and when he cannot deviſe any, he purveys for them abroad in all the world. He alſo injoyns me to return him an anſwer, upon I know not what penalty; and requires, beſides all this, <hi>gratiam celeritatis,</hi> as if it were a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of expedition. He ſhall have neither one nor other, neither anſwer nor diligence. I will preſerve the liberty wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he would bereave me; and if he proceed to moleſt me, make another oath more ſolemn then the firſt. What an imprudence is it, to exact golden Letters of his friends, to demand of me Rhetorical flouriſhes, and <hi>coſi va diſcorrendo,</hi> to the intent he may read me in aſſemblies, and make a Proclamation of our ſecrets? You can teſtifie for me, that I am farre from ingaging in the Trade of a Declamer, which I ſhall ever ſtudiouſly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170361:206"/> avoid. I beſeech you let me know, who that perſon is which takes himſelfe for <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> and treats his friend with the name of <hi>Laelius.</hi> His preſumption certainly deſerves ſevere puniſhment, and I doubt not but one of theſe dayes, the fancy will be in his head to prophane the names of <hi>Agrippa, Mecaenas,</hi> and <hi>Hepheſtion,</hi> in beſtowing them upon ſome miſerable ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel, to whom himſelfe will be <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> That <hi>Vida,</hi> whom we eſteem ſo much, and in whoſe favour <hi>Scaliger</hi> the Son hath written, <hi>Qui de Hieronymo Vida aliter ſentit quàm de ſummo ac perfectiſſimo Poeta nugas agit.</hi> This <hi>Vida,</hi> I ſay, is the true Author of the villany you have ſeen. It is in the Poem which he addreſſes, <hi>Gelelmi Vidae &amp; Leonae Oſcaſalae Manibus.</hi> But we muſt leave all other matters, &amp; give you a recital of the Heroical enterpriſe of a gallant man, which paſs'd through this Country, and is going in queſt of Truth, and good Wine, by Sea and Land. To this effect, he deſigns a Pilgrimage to Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> in imitation of that of <hi>Apollonius</hi> to <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas:</hi> Nevertheleſs he will put off truth, and Monſieur <hi>des Cartes</hi> to the next year, and not paſs the Sea this Campagne. But his other deſign deſerves the knowledge of the whole world. He departed from <hi>Paris</hi> on purpoſe to come and ſee the Sun riſe and ſet at <hi>Balzac,</hi> and ſo forwards, to eat all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons and Figs of <hi>Gaſconie;</hi> and from thence to take the way of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and keep the Vintage of <hi>Frotignac. Alexander</hi> had never ſo rare a thought: The Conqueſt of the Indies is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon to this expedition, and you muſt be more ſparing hereafter in relating to me the voyages of your <hi>Theſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> You muſt further know, that his firſt ſpeech to me, was concerning you, in ſuch manner as I would have all the world ſpeak; and this introduction has ſo well pleas'd me, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had drawn after him, <hi>Maenades, Sileni,</hi> Aſſes and Panthers, I could not have ſhut my Gate upon this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary train. As I had finiſh'd my Letter, he that is the ſubject of it, came hither upon the Gallop, and gave me a ſecond viſit, <hi>matutinam, ſiccam &amp; ſobriam.</hi> But yet I muſt tell you, that this ſobriety is not without ſome conſideration of intereſt; and that he did not forbear his breakfaſt, but for fear it might be prejudiciall to a great dinner which attended him at <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſme.</hi> So that even his abſtinence has intemperance for its object, and is nothing at all agreeable to that of the ancient Fathers in the Deſert.

                  <p>I Pardon our friend his pedantry, if he be aſſur'd of the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and has City-ſecurity for it. He, neer whom he would be placed, has ſometimes the outſide and appearance of an honeſt man, but the bottom of him is a certain cheat. 'Tis a folly to depend upon any thing from him, though after proteſtations, both by word and writing. My indefagitable Scribe has labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for you this week, and will by all means have you ſee my laſt Latine, becauſe it ſeems to him well writ. I do not oppoſe his will, ſince it coſts me nothing but conſent, nor complain of the pains he puts himſelf to. Let him kill you therefore with this ſo often recocted <hi>crambe,</hi> provided you do not ceaſe to be otherwiſe in health, and that it cauſe not the return of your rheume. Never did any buſineſſe finde more protection, then that which I recommended to you, and we are principally indebted to you for the good ſucceſſe. You have obliged Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Voiture,</hi> to contract his gravity in my favour, that Monſieur <hi>de Voiture,</hi> that never ſpeaks without perſwading. You may perhaps think, that I am providing him an accurate complement hereupon; I had indeed once reſolved it, but I lately read in my Stoick Philoſophy, that a wiſe man ought to have a friend, to the end, he may not want one to ſacrifice his life for, if need be.

                  <p>I Cannot tell, if I ſhould at preſent admire the Oration of my Lord <hi>della Caſa;</hi> but it is true, that I did formerly admire it, and had a deſign of publiſhing it with Notes of my own making. This deſire is not yet paſs'd, and I beſeech you to procure a very correct Copy of it, to the end, that when I ſend you mine, you may, by comparing them, judge which of the Manuſcripts is the better. In my opinion, this Florentine was perfectly judicious. He had ſeen the Idea of the higheſt Eloquence: and I cannot agree to the ſentence of Monſieur <hi>Guyet,</hi> who wholly condemns his Latine. Onely I think, the advantage is on the ſide of the Tuſcan, which is more free and naturall. I have review'd my ſecond Apology, and ſhall ſend you them both to be preſented from me, to Madam the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs <hi>de Sable.</hi> I think it will be convenient, to make the Dedication of them to her: And though there are many points of Learning treated therein, above the ordinary capacities of Women; yet my addreſs cannot be reproved, being made to one that tranſcends the generality of that ſex. Beſides, I have a great example to juſtifie the action; and you may poſſibly have obſerv'd, that <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> directs his ſpeech to a Lady of his time, in the Lives which he has written of the Philoſophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Our other incomparable Marchioneſs ſhall likewiſe find a ready obedience from me. I will publiſh the vertue and atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her Fathers, and her brave Romans; and I hope ſhe will be ſatisfi'd with ſomething more then my forward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance to her commands. If I were capable of joy, I ſhould have received it very ſenſibly from your laſt approbation. You are in effect almoſt the onely man whom I deſire to pleaſe, and I am ready to ſay, that <hi>omnes cogitationes meae ad te referuntur, &amp; in te conſumuntur.</hi> Therefore I conjure you to love me, if you would have my ſad life ſuſtain'd yet longer by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and believe not that I labour either for Fortune or Glory. You are the onely end of all my pains. But there is yet one thing which I would obtain of you, that when I ſend you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Latine or my French, you would not advertiſe me of my faults.

                  <p>I Have receiv'd ſo great contentment from the Letter which your friend writ you, as was incapable of addition by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond complement.

He is indeed a very gallant perſon, and agrees with your deſcription. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times what he ſpeaks, deſerves to be alleadged. But is there no means of obtaining of the Ingenious anſwers which he recited to you? it is indifferent to me, whether they come from deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, or are delivered upon the place; whether they be born in the company, or brought from home, provided they be ingenious.

                  <p>I Remain your favourit, during your good pleaſure, and I hope, I ſhall never do any thing to forfeit that title. But, if you pleaſe, do not take me for a follower of <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> for if you do, you will have cauſe one of theſe daies, to accuſe me of lightneſſe, and to brand him with apoſtacy, whom you once termed novice. You will ſee in my ſecond apology, how I have quitted the Caſſock I had taken, and in what manner I had been rebellious againſt the old Stoicall fathers. Yet I conceive, if I remember well the words of my Letter, I ſpoke plainly of that proud Philoſophy, without much declaration for any ſide. I am indeed of a Sect more gentle, or, to ſpeak truer, I am of all Sects, <hi>&amp; nequid tibi diſſimulem, ſine lare &amp; familiâ in Philoſophiâ vagamur, &amp; cum nostro Flacco,</hi>

                     </q> Our friend's Latin ſeems to me very handſome, but his flattery is inſupportable; and as that honeſt man of antiquity, exclaim'd againſt <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Jupiter,</hi> becauſe he favour'd the Barbarians, ſo this new Author diſpleaſes me, becauſe he ſooths up ſuch people, as are not worth his pains. The Letter I writ to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Heinſius,</hi> was neither long nor ſhort, and therefore there muſt be ſomething more in that, that was told you. For the German whom I mentioned to you the other day, called <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes Fredericus Gronovius,</hi> had the like diſcourſe with me; and I know not, if ſome officious unknown perſon, has been diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make himſelf pleaſant with him and me. <hi>Maſcardi</hi> is dead, and we ſhall all die as well as he. But was he ſo eloquent as you ſpeak of? I have ſeen nothing of his making, except ſome Academicall Orations, which were ſhown me ſome four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or fifteen years ſince, and I confeſſe, that I found his Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Proſe as poeticall, as that of <hi>Ciampoli.</hi> A thouſand ſervices to Monſieur <hi>de Voiture,</hi> and all our other friends.

                  <p>I Should be more ſick then you, if informing me of bad newes, you did not likewiſe give me hopes of better for the future: But you are in the mean time in your bed, and the Phyſitians give your rheume the appellation of a Rhumatiſm. For the love of God, dear Sir, have a care of your health, whereof I have more need for my life, then of my own, and conſider me in your perſon. Would not that ſuperſtitious courſe of diet do prejudice, to the nobleneſſe and gallantry of nature? and do you think, the humours would not revolt againſt an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, that endeavours to bring them into abſolute ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? I do not approve ſuch rules of living, except for ſuch decayed bodies as mine, which are incapable of all action, and overwhelm'd with the leaſt burden. Since you are not in the like condition, you ought to take an honeſt liberty, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge your ſelf ſometimes a more geniall fare; I conceive, your blood would by that means become more pure and clear, and that all the ſeditions in the Microcoſm, would be appeas'd and temper'd thereby. But, Sir, you ſpeak very pleaſingly of your malady, your rheumatiſm is eloquent, and every thing flouriſhes in your hands. This gallantry which is mingled with your pains, is an infallible ſigne to me, of your approaching recovery, although you had not otherwiſe given me aſſurance of it; and it cannot be ſaid, there are any ſick people of ſo jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an humour. Monſieur the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucaut,</hi> did me lately the honour of a viſit, and intermitted for ſome hours the great fiſhing he had, in our fair Rivers, that waſhes five or ſix of his Teritorries, which contain twelve large leagues of our Country. You were mentioned in our conference, with all the elogies and admiration, due to a ſupream vertue. He brought with him a Lady of his kindred, whom I had a little before complemented, for a preſent which ſhe ſent me. I imagin'd, you wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the main is, to know, if a Ruſtick is able to diſtinguiſh of delicateneſſe, and without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking one for another: It is your part to clear this doubt:

                  <p>I Have been raviſh'd with joy, at the evidences of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; but you ought not to have attempted ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and ſhould have managed better this firſt favour of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Four lines would have been enough, to have quieted my minde, and given me the information I deſired. But you know not how to keep meaſure, when there is occaſion to oblige; and you account your favours defective, unleſſe they exceed. How few friends are there like yours! and yet fewer Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that are able to retain contentment of minde, in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the body, and loſſe of eſtate! I know ſuch a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur — that would have murmured againſt St. — for leſſe then a rhumatiſm; and the dammage of eight hundred crownes, upon the calling in of mony, hath rather inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienc'd, then troubled you, which would have put <hi>Seneca</hi> into a fret, though inconſiderable to his fortune. You may enquire concerning this of <hi>Dion,</hi> and he will aſſure you, that there is a great difference between the flouriſhes of Theory, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory weapons of Experience; between a Sage upon the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and a Sage upon occaſions. But yet, Sir, I conceive, this ought not to render you diſaffected towards others, nor your force hinder you, from having pitty on the feeble and infirm. You muſt ſuffer men to hope, and deſire ſtill at this day, as they have hop'd and deſir'd ever ſince the beginning of the world. And though covetouſneſſe be not of ſo great antiquity, yet you muſt remember, that you live not in the heroicall times, but in the dregs of the year, ſixteen hundred and forty; and that heretofore, one of your predeceſſors was commended, for ſhewing that favour to the world, which he would not allow to himſelf. Monſieur — pretends to the Prelacy: What is there you find ſo ſtrange and criminall, in his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? are they not the ſame, with thoſe of the greateſt part of the Preachers at <hi>Paris,</hi> who do not much attend to the Greek Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory; nor the example of St. <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Peluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> The worſt I ſee in it, is, that he has diſcovered himſelf to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170361:212"/> a mocker, and declar'd his deſigne with more freedome, then the hypocriſie of the Court permits. But is he not in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of ſuch ſtuffe, as Patriarchs and high Prieſts are made of? and do not you remember, that in the place where he is, there is not ſo poor a Surplice-wearer, but has an eye upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Has he not at leaſt as handſome a name, as the <hi>Signieur de Simeonibus,</hi> whereof he makes mention in his Letter, and which I dannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber without laughter? Does not he well deſerve a title, <hi>in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus infidelium,</hi> ſince he is ſo deſirous of a Dioceſſe, that any would be welcome to him? This ambition does not prejudice civill ſociety, and may be ſuffered in a mean vertue. He may have it, without hating his Prince, without violating friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and without being either a bad Frenchman, or a bad Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And therefore, Sir, though you handſomely reproach my indulgence, I ſhall crave the liberty to continue it, I know not how to declaim againſt ſo many imperfections, purely hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſeeing ſuch a world of monſtrous and groſſe crimes I ſhould have to combat, if I would undertake to be a Reformer. <hi>Quod ad Eminentiſſimum Bentivolum attinet.</hi> You have all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world to blame me, and I confeſſe, I am the moſt ruſtick Provinciall betwixt this and <hi>Paris.</hi> Nevertheleſſe, ſince you have already performed the complement, to which I was oblig'd, I ſhall reſt there. I am not able to add any thing to the perfection of what you do, and will onely tell you, that they are happy faults whereof you are the amender.

You may therefore be pleas'd to underſtand, that I have receiv'd your diſpatch, with the Letter of Monſieur <hi>Conrart,</hi> which could not but be welcome to me in the afflicted condition wherein I languiſh. There came alſo a third in company, whereof I knew almoſt all the contents before, and yet did not conceive my knowledge very great. <hi>Sed nihil hoc ad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromachen,</hi> and our friend has not underſtood me. I did not deſire any news of thoſe <hi>Antipodes</hi> in manners, as <hi>Seneca</hi> calls them, that turn day into night, and night into day, as was the cuſtome of Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> in our times. I would onely have learnt ſomething of certain ſtranger Princes, who, as I am told, made uſe of Torches as well by day as night, out of an humorous and myſterious ceremony. The fire that was carried before the Roman Emperours, as a mark of Soveraignty, whereof as I remember, there are extant but three Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in all Antiquity, namely two in the Hiſtory of <hi>Herodian,</hi> and the third in the Poem of <hi>Corippus,</hi> has a neer reſemblance with this of my preſent enquiry.

If there be any ſuch proud fools, that would be treated as Gods or Idols, let us leave them to burn day-light as long as they pleaſe, and make no further ſearch into the repertories of Paris, which afford us nothing new.

Poſſibly this man may have viſions, and has not read what he believes he did. Nor is it improbable, that he has ill underſtood his Brother's meaning, or put the innocent words upon the rack, to make them ſignifie what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. 'Tis the ordinary vice of Grammarians, ſuch as he is, <hi>quorum proprium eſt malè interpretari, &amp; à mente Auctorum ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius aberrare.</hi> As for my ſelf, Sir, who have known long ſince, and think I have expreſs't as much ſomewhere, that there is no Saint in Heaven, but has been aſperſs'd with unjuſt calumny upon earth; I do not receive all ſorts of teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies indifferently; and before I can believe the evill that is caſt upon a perſon I love, I muſt ſee it clearly, and ſearch it with my fingers. Yet I am not ignorant of the corruption of mankind, nor do I deſire to anſwer, for the honeſty of all the Doctors. But to imagine that all our Societies are full of — and — is beyond my skill; and I could not do it, though I ſhould be accus'd of more then ruſtick ſimplicity, and call'd the ignorant amongſt the great wits of the Academy. Your Jeſuite of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> is a perſon of rare merit, and I eſteem his dozen of Verſes you have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd me with, above all that I have ſeen of — this ten years.

He delivers all that could be expreſs'd in vulgar Proſe, but in ſuch a manner, that the Muſes themſelves could not have ſpoken better, if they had made uſe of the mouth of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> You have much obliged me in copying out that paſſage in the Life of Monſieur <hi>de Peireſk,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns your ſelfe and me.

I beſeech God comfort you with ſome good news from <hi>Germany.</hi> I tremble at the onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of what you write me thence, and unleſſe <hi>fata viam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,</hi> I cannot tell how your Heroe can ſave himſelfe.

                  <p>THough the Greeks have a proverb, that offends the ſons of the gods, yet I do not believe, that the Counts of <hi>Dunois</hi> of former times, were more honourable perſons, then the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> of the preſent. The laſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, whereof your Letter gives me relation, made me trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the reading; my imagination is ſtill unſetled, and I fear for them that are eſcaped, as if I ſaw them yet in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and amidſt the difficulties of the paſſage. Without queſtion, Sir, Heaven has ſome extraordinary deſigne for your Prince. Men are not leſſe frequently deceived in their fears, then in their hopes; and I have obſerved in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of all Ages, that great forces have almoſt ever perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med but little, and ſuch as were inconſiderable, very much.</p>

                  <p>But you muſt remember, that <hi>Teucer</hi> made this Oration amongſt his cups; and likewiſe obſerve, that 'tis from the banks of <hi>Bacchara,</hi> (which the Latiniſts of <hi>Germany</hi> derive by Etymologie from <hi>Bacchi ara</hi>) that the <hi>Nectar Rhenanum</hi> is gather'd, which may perhaps have fill'd your Army with Enthuſiaſm. But, Sir, you return me the title of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, with too great humility, I cannot accept an honour, whereof I am ſo undeſerving, nor ſuffer you to call me your Book, who are to me both a Library and an Univerſity. If you provoke me further, I will term you my Tripod and my Oracle, and treat you as <hi>Apollo,</hi> or at leaſt as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and a man inſpired by ſome deity. But, out of raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, you know the high eſteem I have of your great capacity, and the reverence I bear to all that you pronounce, <hi>ex ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra;</hi> I uſe this word, becauſe you many times ſend me the advices of others, for your own. And though I very much prize the wit and eloquence of our acquaintance, yet I do not acknowledge them for Judges and Soveraigns. Since you are curious to know, who the father <hi>Teron</hi> is, whom I believed, you had known better then my ſelf, I ſhall tell you, that he is a Poet of ſeventy five years old: Soon after
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170361:217"/> the birth of the King, he compos'd two Poems of little Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which they call <hi>Glyconiques;</hi> and the late King, upon the favourable applauſe that was given them, commanded <hi>Molin</hi> to tranſlate them; they are entitled, <hi>Les Couronnes,</hi> and <hi>Les Dauphins,</hi> and were printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> the Latin on one ſide, and the French <hi>è regione.</hi> Theſe two works are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very commendable, and I am aſſured they will find your approbation. I have ſeen other things of his, wherein I obſerv'd an excellent genius; but I know, that he is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe enclin'd to idleneſſe, and a workman, that of all the world, loves his own trade leaſt. I had good ſtore of other newes to requite you with, and but for this diverſion, you had not been diſcharged at ſo cheap a rate. Monſieur <hi>de Thou,</hi> who turned out of his way, to do me the honour of a viſit, had the patience to relate them four and twenty hours together, which were ſo pleaſing and agreeable, that they ſeem'd to me ſcarce four and twenty minutes.

                  <p>I Perceive I muſt conteſt no longer with you, about the worth of my words; they ſhall be rated at what value you put upon them, and be accounted handſome, ſince they pleaſe you. I would onely deſire, they were as ſtrong, as by your favour they are gracefull, and that I had the faculty of healing with my words, as well as, in your belief, I have that of praiſing; I would not deny ſo eaſie remedies at this time, but prepare them with all the skill, whereof I am capable, to the end they might operate more effectually, againſt the feavour of your friend. It ſhould alſo be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to make experience in my own perſon, and the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian undertake the cure of himſelf: But there is no mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, for ſuch old and obſtinate maladies as mine; 'tis here, that the rhetorick of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> yea and the magick of <hi>Zoroaſter,</hi> would manifeſt the weakneſſe and impotency of their Art. There will certainly come better times then theſe, and we ſhall be well one day, at leaſt at the day of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>cum mortale hoc noſtrum induet immortalitatem, &amp; in gloriâ reſurgemus,</hi> by the grace and mercy of our Lord. I think I ſent you my opinion, of the Verſes of the Lyrick <hi>Madelenet;</hi> for the others of raillerie, whereof you ſpeak, I have no curioſity to ſee them. The raillery of this man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſeem'd to me ſo cold and flat, that it was not poſſible for me to laugh at it; and if I were in the place where you are, and a neceſſity lay'd upon me to commend them, 'tis ſo hard for me to go againſt my knowledge, that I ſhould rather die at that inſtant. I am aſtoniſhed at what I hear, of Doctor <hi>Palemon;</hi> I believ'd that he liv'd onely in ſpirit, and that he was ſo perſwaded of the immortality of the ſoul,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170361:219"/> whereof he ſpeaks ſo much, that he held no longer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with his ſenſes: But I perceive, he is one of thoſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall Philoſophers, who contented themſelves with diſcourſing of vertue, and never took further pains to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. It may pleaſe God to give him better thoughts one day, and poſſibly he has permitted the publication of the ſecret of this brave man, to the end he may hereafter make him a great Saint. I am,</p>

                  <p>TO loſe nothing in this bad age, 'tis the onely ſecurity to poſſeſſe nothing, If you have ſuffered great loſſes, 'tis becauſe you had great riches; <hi>Magnae opes, amiciſſime Capel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane, magnae jacturae locum faciunt. Quid verò inter opes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus &amp; praeſtantius veris &amp; bonae fidei amicis?</hi> I will believe the perſon you lament, worthy of your tears; and although his merit be ſufficiently problematicall in the judgement of the people: Yet I know the people is but a bad eſteemer of worth, and their averſion is many times, as unjuſt as their love. But however it be, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> is dead, and ſo is the Duke of <hi>Weymar?</hi> and if a man out-live War and Combats, he comes at laſt to dye in Feaſts and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs. Let us look upon all men as loſt, or ready to be ſo, and account every hour of our life for Climactericall. Let us expect bad news by each Poſt, and conclude, that the onely means to avoid being afflicted, is to be none of this world. In effect, Sir, we muſt either ſee others periſh, or periſh our ſelves; and therefore, what unreaſonable deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateneſs is it, to be in love with life, and not to be able to endure the appendances that accompany it? and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is it to bewail an evill, whereunto all the world cannot afford a remedy? I have long ſince left the Stoicks their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility; yet am not in the contrary extream. I remember a Rime rhat begins thus, <hi>Thy tender pitty makes me pitty thee, &amp;c.</hi> and flouts the good nature of one of our friends. As I do not approve the heart of ſteel of <hi>Zeno,</hi> and his eyes of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mice; ſo neither can I commend thoſe that were turn'd into
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170361:220"/> fountains, in the Regions of Metamorphoſes, or at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came blear-ey'd all the reſt of their lives. This ſoftneſſe cannot befoll a ſoul of that firm conſtitution as yours; ſo that you will not fail to maintain your place between the two extreams, where there is honeſt and aſſured content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Your Predeceſſour, Monſieur <hi>de Malherbe,</hi> will tell you, that King <hi>Priam,</hi> King <hi>Francis,</hi> and himſelfe, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; and that it is permitted to every one to doe the like. 'Tis very true as you tell me, that the Princes do at length become weary of the Warre, and that the <hi>Caducei</hi> of my Lords the Nuntio's, will have the virtue to ſeparate the Combatants, who are ſo exaſperated and cruelly animated againſt one another. If his Holineſſe be the Author of this great good, he will receive as many benedictions as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes, and the Orator <hi>Jean: Jaques,</hi> ſhall be commiſſion'd to make him an ample Remerciment in the name of all Chriſtendom.

I was indiſpos'd when I writ to Monſieur <hi>de la Nauue;</hi> and if there were any thing in my Letter that deſerves your eſteem, it ought to be rather aſcrib'd to fortune, then to me, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed no more then a good intention. This, indeed is ſo pure, that I will not deny but it merits your allowance; and you muſt, at leaſt, conſider it as an honeſt and generous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, which having nothing but deſires to give, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be accus'd of ſparing them. As for the praiſes which are burthenſome to your modeſty, I beſceech you to believe, that they are neither amplifications, nor common places. I am ſo throughly perſwaded of your vertue, that when I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the like teſtimony of it, I imagine thar I am holding up my hand, and ſwearing before a Judge. If the Demon of <hi>Socrates</hi> did report you, all that paſs'd in your abſence, you would know, that I never ſpeak of you, but I am tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170361:220"/> and that in this I imitate the Sybills, who delivered their predictions with fury. Concerning the other part of your Letter, I declare unto you, that I will not undertake to plead the cauſe of the accuſed; and that I neither juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nor condemn at the firſt ſight. Yet I know, that all the witneſſes againſt him are not ſo faithfull as I, and that the greateſt part of advices, are like Heroick Poets, who upon a ſmall foundation of truth, build a prodigious ſtructure of Lyes. How many wicked minds, are there, that wiſh an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Warre, that are onely fit to break friendſhips, to hinder reconcilements, and to cheriſh and improve the ſeeds of hatred. But the buſineſſe muſt be further cleared, and our judgments ſuſpended till then.

<q>Est bene non potuit dicere, dixit erit.</q> She is in the ſame note at this day; and therefore let us hope well for the future. Let us judge favourably of our affairs in <hi>Germany,</hi> and not imagine, that the fortune of our Army is dead, with its firſt Generall; at leaſt, let us content our ſelves with preſent loſſes, and the miſeries that arive every hour. Calamities come faſt enough, without being anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our fears; as it alſo continues to long, although we take no pains to preſerve it in our memories. I expect the book of Monſieur <hi>de la Chambre,</hi> with much zeal and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince we are now entred upon the holy week; without doubt, he has made ſome new diſcoveries touching the Paſſions, for he long ſince deſign'd them an argument for his pen, and told me, he would treat of them, as a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170361:221"/> and in another way then that of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> He has a wit pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and confident, and a ſtyle not unpleaſing. When I was at <hi>Paris,</hi> he gave me a view of a great ſtore of his exeellent Merchandiſes. So that to do well, he needs underſtand no more, then to make a good choice, wherein the goodneſſe of his judgment will ſecure him from errour. But, I beſeech you, who is the Author of the French Verities, that did me the favour to ſend me his books? The ſame day I receiv'd them, they were taken from me by a friend; ſo that having not yet read them, I cannot tell you my opinion of their worth. In the mean time, be pleaſed to let him know, that I am obliged to him for his preſent, and give him all the thanks I am able. I am more troubled for the health of our dear Monſieur, the Abbot of <hi>Bois-Robert,</hi> then for my penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If by your credit and his, it happen to be paid, this little ſuccour will come conveniently, to repair ſome breaches of the laſt year: But I ought to thank none but you and him for it, ſince you will procure me a thing, which was not ſo much in my thoughts as to ask it. I was formerly yours by abundance of titles, but I ſhall moreover be now ſo, by that of your moſt humble Penſioner. I am,</p>

This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed too much already, and I dare not believe the reſt, nor imagine, that I merited thoſe acclamations you ſpeak of. Thoſe Ladies are for the ſublimity of eloquence, and cannot reliſh the meanneſſe of mine; <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> is a more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Author to them, then I, and they have rather applauded the Text then the Preacher.

                  <p>I Am of late become deaf to the bruit of applauſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of all the allurements of glory. Yet I have very quick reſentments of friendſhip, and it is that which makes ſomethings pretious to me, which otherwiſe in themſelves I ſhould look upon as indifferent. Therefore the praiſes of ſtrangers do no longer pleaſe me as formerly. I call them of ſtrangers, with diſtinction from yours, whereof I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver glutted, <hi>tam gratum eſt à te laudari.</hi> All the reliſh that I finde in the elogies of others, proceeds from the ſeaſoning that you give them. 'Tis not Monſieur <hi>de Thou</hi> that deſcribes <hi>Florent Chreſtien</hi> ſo graphically, but one of his friends. <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vola nempe Sammarthanus in aureolo Elogiorum libello, digno, me judice, omnium Bemborum &amp; ſadoletorum invidiâ.</hi> But are you ſerious, when you ſpeak of <hi>Ronſard,</hi> and give him the title of Grand? or is it onely out of modeſty, and to oppoſe his greatneſſe to your tenuity? As for me, I eſteem him not great, except in the ſenſe of the old proverb, <hi>Magnus liber, magnum malum;</hi> and I have declared as much in one of my latin Letters, which you ſuffered to paſſe, without making any oppoſition. Since the thing is done, there is no place left for denial; and Monſieur <hi>de Malberbe,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Graſſe,</hi> and your ſelf, muſt come into the number of ſmall Poets, if he be allow'd to paſſe for great. I dare not preſume to give ſo much trouble to Monſieur the Abbot of <hi>Bois Robert,</hi> who could not bear it, without notable prejudice to his health. Oblige me therefore to tell him, when you ſee him, that provided he recover, and God preſerve me ſo dear a friend, I will no more lament my particular unhappineſſes, or thoſe of the times. If he ſhould hereupon offer to make me a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of two lines, I conjure you to reſtrain him from it by violence, and do not ſuffer, that I become the occaſion of a ſecond malady, which would add nothing to the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance I have already of his affection. I am,</p>

All that you ſay is extreamly handſome, and the little <hi>Aſtyanax</hi> ſmiles, not onely on his father <hi>Hector,</hi> when he is going to die by the hand of <hi>Achilles,</hi> but alſo upon <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> his executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, as he caſts him headlong from the Tower. Nor does the Swine make good chear onely in the tempeſt, whilſt men are at their prayers and vowes; but at the ſame time the knife is put to his throat, he knowes not whether he be tickled or hurt. O free and naturall Philoſophy! much leſſe artificiall and diſſembled, then that of the Philoſopher <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon!</hi> We profeſſe one ſort, as you ſay excellently, that was diſcover'd for the ruine of all others. Let us follow its maxims, and the doctrine of the Goſpell, and we ſhall have compaſſion of all Sects and Sectaries. I read with joy that article of your Letter, wherein you ſpeak of Monſieur the Abbot <hi>de la Victoire,</hi> and am infinitely pleaſed with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of that ſociety. <hi>Nobile certè par, ſed utinam per Balza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium impar.</hi> Beſides the affection I bear him, there is ſcarce a Prelate in all our Hierarchy, of whom I ſet a higher va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.

                  <p>I Have told you a thouſand times, and tell you this once more, that you alwaies diſcover reaſon in whatever place it is hidden. I know not what opinion <hi>Cicero</hi> had of glory, in the books that he made; but I am confident, Praiſe is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170361:223"/> worth neither more nor leſſe, then as you rate it; you have ſet it at a juſt price, and not onely the rigour of Philoſophy, but even Chriſtian humility, might dain to taſte it of your preparation. I think, he on whom people caſt their eyes, for inſtructor to the Prince, is the ſame whom they deſire to employ, in the negotiation of the Peace. Theſe thoughts do him no injury, and the deſtination, that judges him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſo high and important affairs, ought not to diſpleaſe him, though he have no deſigne to undertake them. My judgment herein ſhall alwaies conform to his. And be it, that he go to <hi>Collen,</hi> or lodge in the Palace-Royall, or keep himſelf in his Cloſet, I will believe, he could not poſſibly do better then he will choſe to do. Monſieur <hi>de la Mothe ie Vayer,</hi> has taught me many things, whereof I was ignorant, and confirm'd me in ſome that I knew before. There cannot be a work more rich and abſolute then his, and he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely obliged me with his preſent. I beſeech you to aſſure him, of my acknowledgments for this favour, and preſerve me in his good opinion. You ſee, Sir, it is by you, that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain commerce with honeſt men; and I am priz'd by them, onely according to the eſteem you make of me. But there can nothing be added to my gratitude, for your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and I am more perfectly then any perſon in the world,</p>

It is certain, that a genius and judgment, are the two eſſentiall parts of a Poet; and I reſt ſatisfied, with all that you have told me thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But having ſubmitted my ſelf intirely to your authority, you would have me a little content my reaſon. Permit me therefore to read <hi>Ronſard</hi> again over, for upon the laſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170361:224"/> I thought him rather the matter and beginning of a Poet, then one accompliſh'd; and in the fire wherewith his imagination was heated, there was much leſſe of flame, then ſmoak and foot. You know the fancy of the late Monſieur <hi>de Malherbe,</hi> that blotted out a whole Volume with his own hand, and did not pardon one ſyllable; I do not approve his rigour ſo univerſall. But if all the Sonnets, all the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciade, and all the Odes were loſt, I think, I ſhould not need much comfort againſt my ſorrow. I have written in Latine to Monſieur <hi>Silhon,</hi> what I conceived both of the one and the other; I mean, of the Martyr and the Tyrant, <hi>Ronſard</hi> and <hi>Malherbe.</hi> Be pleaſed for my ſake, to read that part over again, and ſend me your opinion of it, to the end I may know if mine be right, and I may hold me to it. I am raviſh'd with the ſecond article of your Letter, and cannot ſufficiently commend the judgment, prudence, and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, which you manifeſt in the Treaty, whereof I made the overture. I hope the ſucceſſe will be happy, and that you will have no cauſe, either to reproach my credulity, or repent the confidence you have put in me. God forbid, I ſhould have a deſigne to deceive you; I have all the morall aſſurances that can be had, of the faith of another. And if I were not certain, that I beſtow a try'd friend upon you, I ſhould not be ſo forward, to be the inſtrument of the new friendſhip, which I propoſe you; if any evill ever come of it, <hi>Dii in me convertant.</hi> I am paſſionately,</p>

Be pleaſed to tell him, that I have anſwer'd him in the vulgar language, for the ſame reaſon that <hi>Statius,</hi> being to ſpeak of <hi>Lucan,</hi> durſt not venture to do it in heroick Verſe:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170361:224"/>

                  <p>YOu ever make the two hardeſt parts of the argument, and leave me onely the pains to draw out the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Let this glorious liberty flouriſh, and let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne all Tyranny in the affairs of Philoſophy. You ſpeak admirably, that <hi>our reaſon ought to yield obedience to nothing but reaſon,</hi> and that <hi>Authority is a yoak, which Religion onely has right to impoſe upon the judgments of men.</hi> Upon theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, I ſhall take the freedome, to diſſent ſometimes from the Paradoxes of <hi>Zeno,</hi> to debate the opinions of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and to queſtion the maxims of <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> eſpecially when he ſpeaks Latin, to a man that underſtands it not. For the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Monſieur — which I ſend you, I had much ado to arive at the end of it, it ſeemed longer to me then the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170361:225"/> 
                     <hi>Eccleſiastes,</hi> the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the book of <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> yea, then that ſtupendious volume, wherein he treated of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and the properties of all Plants. Is it poſſible, that a man ſhould write Letters of ſupererogation, to another man that he knowes not? and that the ſame man ſhould have an imagination, ſtrong enough to perſwade himſelf, that he knowes that man, and that he received Letters from him, and the Hiſtory of the Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his own with him. Without queſtion, this is one of my Antipodes, and of a contrary nature to the negligent perſon, that never writes Letters when civility requires it, or his affairs urge it, or even neceſſity ſeems to enforce it; I had almoſt ſlipt a great word, nor when Monſieur <hi>Chapelain</hi> appoints it, which is more powerfull with me, then neceſſity it ſelf. But you ſay nothing of Monſieur <hi>l'Huilier,</hi> who is an antient Roman diſguis'd, and makes Elogies, of neer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with thoſe of <hi>Ovid;</hi> I would gladly ſee them at the end of the life of his friend, Monſieur <hi>du Peiresk,</hi> with all the pomp and gallantry of the Impreſſion.

He will not be backward, to enjoy the honour of your company, and verifie all that I have ſaid or written of him, at ſeveral times. I have added five or ſix Verſes to the laſt Latin Letter, which I writ to Monſieur <hi>Maynard,</hi> wherein you will perceive, that I ſpend all my gall againſt the old Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the end I may take away all ambiguity and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation. <hi>Scis enim iis temporibus Poëtae objectum eſſe, quod Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnoni maledixiſſet.</hi> I am,</p>

I will not here repeat his, becauſe I do not diſtruſt your memory; nor tell you any thing new of him, having left him in perfect health, the laſt time I ſaw him.

                  <p>I Am much obliged to you for thoſe things, for which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your cuſtome, you make excuſes. After an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, that might befit <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> you are aſhamed of your good cheer. As for me, it gave infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; and could I do it honeſtly, and without incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I would conjure you, to perſecute and annoy me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in that manner. The royalty of reaſon could not be more ſtoutly maintained, againſt the uſurpation of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And notwithſtanding your endeavour, to hide and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the power and vigour of your eloquence, yet there breaks from you ſuch rayes and evidences of it, as did of courage and manhood from <hi>Achilles,</hi> when diſguis'd in the habit of a virgin. Thus we repay the cenſures, which the vulgar paſſe upon us; and neither the reſpect of number, nor the continued ſeries of Ages, nor the good fortune of Sects and Schooles, are able to miſguide us in our ſentence. That which you ſay of <hi>the ſoveraignty of Reaſon, and the ſeat of her
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170361:227"/> Empire, of her dreſſes and attendants, and the Grotto whither ſhe retires, &amp;c.</hi> What is all this, Sir, but to proclaim a truth magnificently, and to attire your Queen with purple and cloth of gold. But to paſſe from the Throne of this Queen, to her Chariot of Triumph; that is, from your Proſe to your Verſe, wherein your Virgin tranſcends the ſplendour and glory, of all conquerours of the other ſex, and is no leſſe beholding to your Pen, than her own Sword. In requitall of your French, I have ſent you ſome Latin numbers, which your Letter told me you deſired; but inſtead of ſix Verſes, which I formerly mentioned, you may perceive them mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed to thirty. Perhaps they will pleaſe ſuch as know the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as you do, and have ſeen the ambitious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of its Courtiers, where there is choice of Cavaliers of five or ſix ſorts for attendants, at the rate of a <hi>Julio</hi> a piece by the day; with which miſerable pittance, they quiet their eager appetites. But, as I conjecture, that which will leaſt diſpleaſe you, is my <hi>Bacchus Laborans,</hi> who does no longer remember that he was once a conquerour, and the three goddeſſes that accompany him. One, half-learn'd, and that never heard but of <hi>Priapus,</hi> or at moſt of <hi>Vertumnus,</hi> will haply wonder to ſee <hi>Venus</hi> in the place, that he thinks belongs to them; but not you, Sir, who have ſhown me, <hi>Hortos olim tutelae <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eneris aſſignatos, Plauto &amp; Plinio teſtibus: &amp; meministi etiam illud Naevii.</hi>

If theſe words are injurious, I have no underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in quarrells or injuries.

                  <p>BY the laſt Poſt, I received the diſcourſe and the Verſes, you were pleaſed to ſend me; I have a great obligation to you for them, but yet a greater, for four lines I read in your Letter, then for all beſides in the Packet. You were ſcrupulous, of letting it come into my hands, and there was a great combat hereupon, between your inclination, and your engagement. Theſe words, Sir, are infinitely obliging, although they ſhould not be true; but being moſt certainly ſo, they affect me very ſenſibly, and I declare unto you, that I am ſufficiently comforted for all my afflictions, by the preference that you give me above all the world, in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of your friendſhip. That which the famous Drinker told you, hath freed me from my jealouſie and unquiet; for as affection is ingenious to preſage ill, and ever concludes to the worſt, I did already apprehend ſomething more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, then a rheume. I was in fear, that our friend was gone a longer voyage then he promiſed; or, if you pleaſe, that I ſpeak leſſe vulgarly, I miſdoubted, that <hi>Menander,</hi> the maker of Epigrams, was gone to finde <hi>Menander</hi> the writer of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; I mean onely of his death, for God forbid that I ſhould aſſigne him the ſame place of reſidence in the other
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170361:228"/> life. The ninteenth of this month is paſt, and four daie would have brought him from his own houſe to <hi>Balzac</hi> This is a cauſe of new trouble, unleſſe he come ſpeedily, or make me underſtand the reaſon of his delay. The inclemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the ſeaſon is an excuſe too allowable to detain him. And though I paſſionately deſire to ſee him, yet I know not, if I ought to wiſh a perſon ſo dear to me, expos'd unto all the injuries of an intemperate aire, and that at the age of neer ſixty yeers: he ſhould ſleight the menaces of the god <hi>Perewig'd with Icycles,</hi> &amp; Winter with his ratling beard, which another Poet calls, The god of old age. My Stationer lately ſent me a Treatiſe of Monſieur <hi>de Prieſac,</hi> wherein I have obſerved a great number of rarities. Whatever he delivers of his own invention, is alwaies good; and he appropriates ſo handſomely, that which he borrowes from antiquity, that it is hard to diſtinguiſh the forrain from the native. His ſtyle is otherwiſe noble, and he has nothing of the barbarity of our Provinces. But beſides all this, it muſt be confeſs'd, that he improves his art to admiration, and that as often as he has occaſion to uſe the Civill Law, he does it in ſuch manner, that the moſt dry and thorny pieces, become flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and glorious in his hands, and that even they read him with delight; <hi>qui voluptatis tantum cauſâ legunt,</hi> and have guſt for nothing but Romances. As ſoon as you meet him, I beſeech you aſſure him of my humble ſervice; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if you pleaſe, that my eſteem and my affection are two ſeparate things; and 'tis not for love of him, that I commend the Book of his that was ſent me. I ſhould be glad to ſee the oratoriall Proſe, of Monſieur <hi>de St. Blancet;</hi> he has both wit and confidence, and <hi>ſi peccat, imitatione tantum peccat.</hi> I am,</p>

                  <p>MY friendſhip is ever inconſiderable, and although it were not troubleſome, yet it is ſo barren and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that it cannot be eſteemed of any value, but by one that is wholly diſ-intereſſed from it. But as for yours, how infinitely precious is it! I dare not engage my ſelf into a matter, ſo vaſt and ſpatious; and it ſuffices me to tell you; as I am wont, that it is the onely joy of my life, and all the delight of my ſoul. So that although I move not out of my own juriſdiction, and am forc'd to deliberate concerning the journey of a league, I ſhall become man enough, to creep as far as <hi>Paris,</hi> for the onely deſire I have to ſee you; where I will appear on a ſuddain in your chamber; and break out of the cloud with theſe words, <hi>Coram quem diligis adſum,</hi> with a deſigne too of continuing ſome time with you; but abſolutely <hi>incognito,</hi> and without diſcovering my ſelf to any other whatſoever. Then it ſhall be, that we will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey all the graces and beauties of the Virgin, to our wiſh; and I wil give him cauſe that ſhal write your life, to inform poſterity, that a poor Paralytick went from the River of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renta,</hi> on purpoſe to hear the melody of the Swan of <hi>Seine.</hi> Is it not true, Sir, that the Hiſtory of the Man of <hi>Calis,</hi> is not very excellent? And do not you believe, that I have more eſteem and paſſion for you, then he had for <hi>Livy.</hi> He that I term'd the vertuous man, appear'd ſuch to me, the day that I gave him that title; but another time, I ſhall poſſibly call him by another name, becauſe he may appear in another ſhape, or I look upon him with other eyes. So it is, that I will not warrant my courteſies, or undertake to make good any thing, except what I ſay of you. <hi>Non enim hic prolixus lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſed juratus testis Balzacius eſt.</hi> The divers employments that Monſieur <hi>Girard</hi> has for his Maſter, are without doubt nothing, but the jealous and treacherous perſons, of whom you complain, and who have detain'd him from giving you a ſecond viſit. His brother, to whom, with your conſent, I ſhew all your Letters, has not fail'd to repreſent him your diſcontentments, and the diffidence which you have taken as unjuſtly againſt your ſelfe, as you expreſſe it agreeably and with applauſe. The rigour of the weather hinders me
